// this repository: the whole schema, the security rules, the sign-in gateway.
// The only thing standing between a fresh clone and a working church app was
// two settings, and the instructions for them lived in a document that asked a
// non-programmer to create a file with a leading dot, in the right folder, with
// two exact variable names spelled correctly and no trailing spaces.
//
// That is not a setup step, it is a spelling test, and it is the one that was
// failing people. This script asks two questions and writes the file.
//
// It never touches the network and never sends anything anywhere. It reads two
// values you paste, checks their SHAPE only, and writes them to `.env.local`,
// which .gitignore already refuses to commit.
