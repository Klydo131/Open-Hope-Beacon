// What an iPhone needs before "Add to Home Screen" produces an app.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, reported as "iPhone and iPad users cannot install
// the app, in Chrome or in Safari".
//
// `appleWebApp: { capable: true }` in app/layout.tsx no longer emits what its
// name says. Next emits the STANDARDISED `mobile-web-app-capable`, and Safari
// has never read that name -- it reads `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` and
// nothing else. So the built head carried a capable tag that Safari ignores and
// no capable tag that it honours.
//
// Without it, Add to Home Screen makes a BOOKMARK. Tapping the icon opens
// Safari with the address bar showing. Nothing errors, nothing warns: the
// person followed the steps, got an icon, tapped it, and landed in a browser.
// Reported as "the install does not work", which is an accurate description.
//
// Safari 17.4+ reads `display` from the manifest and copes without the tag.
// Every iPhone below that needs it, and on a congregation's phones that is a
// great many of them.
//
// THIS CHECKS THE BUILT HTML, NOT THE SOURCE. The whole failure was a framework
// changing what a source setting emits, so reading app/layout.tsx would have
// confirmed the bug was absent while it was shipping. Only the output settles
// it, which is why this test needs a server and lives with the e2e-ish checks.
