// WHAT WAS REPORTED. "Some users didn't like the white noise because some of it
// are not pleasing." Three separate things were true, and a flat list of three
// buttons hid all of them:
//
//   * Every option was noise, and one was raw white noise -- flat all the way
//     up, the harshest sound a speaker can make. It sat in the same
//     undifferentiated list as the gentle ones.
//   * Nothing moved. A two-second buffer looped forever at one level is a wall,
//     and a wall is tiring within minutes however well its colour was chosen.
//   * Every entry had a one-line description of what it sounded like, written
//     the day the file was, and NO SCREEN HAD EVER DRAWN ONE. The information
//     that would have let somebody avoid the harsh one was in the source.
