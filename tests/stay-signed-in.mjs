// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR: "Your account is not ready. JWT expired."
//
// A Supabase access token lasts ONE HOUR. A refresh token lasts months and is
// what turns that into staying signed in on a device. Nothing here ever used
// the refresh token, so every member was signed out an hour after signing in
// and told their account was not ready, which is not what had happened.
//
// WHY THE CHECK IS ON THE SOURCE. The failure is a timing one: it needs a real
// token, a real hour and a real Supabase to reproduce, and by the time a
// browser test could see it the person is already signed out. What can be
// checked here are the four properties that make the refresh correct, each of
// which is a way this has gone wrong in real applications.

// once. The in-flight promise above stops two refreshes racing inside one page;
// it cannot stop two places. The loser got a 400, called clearBrowserSession(),
// and destroyed the good session the winner had just written. Both contexts
// were then signed out, while both screens carried on showing the person's

// person's name on it, while every request behind it went out as nobody and
// each card filled with "permission denied". Signed out at the network and
// signed in on the screen is the worst of both — unusable, and not offering
// the one action that would fix it.
