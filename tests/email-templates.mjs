// The two rules that made an invitation arrive as a blank message.
//
// These templates are pasted into the Supabase dashboard rather than deployed,
// so nothing else in this repository ever executes them. That is exactly why
// they need a check: a mistake here is invisible until somebody reports an
// empty email, and the person who reports it is a stranger being invited to a
// church.
//
// RULE 1 — A SHORT LIST OF VARIABLES, AND NEVER {{ .ConfirmationURL }}.
//
// Two separate failures produced this rule, and they pull in opposite
// directions, so both halves are checked.
//
// A template that also used {{ .Email }} was delivered with nothing in the body
// at all. Go renders these, and a field it cannot resolve aborts the render
// rather than leaving a gap, so a blank message is the failure mode and no
// dashboard anywhere reports it. Hence: a short allow-list.
//
// And {{ .ConfirmationURL }} points at Supabase's own /auth/v1/verify, which
// SPENDS THE TOKEN on any GET, before redirecting. A mail scanner, a corporate
// filter or a phone previewing the message burns the link, and the invited
// person is told it expired on their first open. Every time, for months, with
// nothing they did wrong. So the templates build the link themselves out of
// {{ .TokenHash }} and hand it to /join, which redeems it in the browser where
// no scanner follows.
//
// RULE 2 — NO HTML COMMENTS.
//
// Documentation lived at the top of both files and was pasted along with them.
// A comment in a pasted template is body content a client may or may not strip,
// and a {{ ... }} written inside one is still substituted, because Go templating
// has never heard of an HTML comment.
