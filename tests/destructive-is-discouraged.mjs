// The most damaging button on a screen is never the most inviting one.
//
// THE REPORT, from a Director's pairings screen: "I dont like that the size of
// Disconnect is bigger than Connect... We discourage Directors and EDs to
// delete and disconnect people but it's a second option just in case something
// bad happens only."
//
// Disconnecting two people, or removing somebody from the church, is something
// a Director must be able to do and should almost never want to. It was drawn
// as an ordinary `ghost` button: same height, same weight, same everything as
// the controls around it, which is precisely how a screen says "this action is
// routine". Four other places had already noticed and patched a red TEXT colour
// on top of a ghost button, which made them red and left them full size.
//
// So: one `danger` variant, smaller than an ordinary button and the only red
// thing in the app, and a rule that destructive actions use it.
//
// WHY THE RULE IS ON THE SOURCE. Nothing renders here — these are live screens
// behind a database session this sandbox does not have. And the failure is not
// a crash: it is a button that looks a little too willing, which nobody notices
// until a Director taps the wrong one and somebody's conversation is gone.
