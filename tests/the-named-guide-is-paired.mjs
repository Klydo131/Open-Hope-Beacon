// A Guide chosen on an invitation is paired the moment the Explorer arrives.
//
// WHAT WAS REPORTED. "The pair with Guide when I invite an Explorer for the
// first time is not working in the sub room approval. If I pair an invited
// Explorer to a guide, they should be paired right away."
//
// THREE SEPARATE BUGS SAT ON ONE PATH, and only the third is the reported one.
// All three were found by probing the live database, not by reading.
//
//   ONE. The approval itself FAILED: "there is no unique or exclusion
//   constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification". The Director got an
//   error and the person stayed unapproved. Self-inflicted the same day --
//   `a_pair_can_be_made_again` dropped the unconditional UNIQUE (ds_id, dm_id)
//   for good reasons, and a trigger written long before said
//   `on conflict (ds_id, dm_id)`, which needs exactly that index.
//
//   TWO. `do nothing` was wrong anyway. Disconnecting ARCHIVES a pairing, so
//   for anybody previously paired with that Guide the row already existed and
//   DO NOTHING silently skipped -- on the exact path a Director uses to re-pair
//   somebody.
//
//   THREE, THE REPORTED ONE. An invited Explorer is never approved, because
//   they ARRIVE approved: `handle_new_user` sets is_approved at signup for
//   anybody holding an Explorer invitation. The pairing hung off
//   `after update of is_approved`, and that transition never happens for them.
//   For a first-time invited Explorer the trigger had never once fired. The
//   Guide was written on their profile and nothing ever read it.
//
//   node tests/the-named-guide-is-paired.mjs
