//
//   "I want the sample lesson studies to have sources with the 7th day
//   Adventist sources please, not some random published no basis points...
//   I dont want to see lesson studies that are just random automated by AI, it
//   must have a strong content with strong sources too."
//
//   "Also please remove the churchy words for Explorers since they are new in
//   faith too, let's focus more on Christ centered them for Explorers for we
//   dont know if they have sensitive to religion or not."
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. The four example series read pleasantly and cited NOTHING.
// Each lesson was about 360 characters with a Bible reference and no indication
// of where the thinking came from -- which is precisely what machine-written
// filler looks like from the outside, and left a Guide with no answer to "says
// who?".
