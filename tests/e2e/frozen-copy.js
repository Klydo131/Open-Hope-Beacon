// it rules IN the one state that system cannot fix. Hosts give previews and
// individual deployments their own hostnames, and to a browser a different
// hostname is a different app: its own icon, its own worker, its own storage.
// A copy installed from one of those is frozen at the build that was there on
// the day, for ever, and from the inside it looks exactly like a healthy one.
//
// The app already knew — onCanonicalHost() — and said nothing.
//
// THE CONTROL IS THE WHOLE TEST. A banner that never appears would satisfy any
// check that only looks at the healthy case, and a banner that always appears
// would terrify every ordinary user. Both are run here.

// CANONICAL_HOST is stamped into the bundle at build time, so "frozen" and
// "healthy" cannot be two ports against one build — rebuilding for the second
// replaced .next underneath the first server and both then served the same
// answer. Run it twice:
