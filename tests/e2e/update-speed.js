// How fast does a running app notice a new release, and what does it cost?
//
// The owner's sentence was "let's make it more reliable, up to date and fast
// enough so we won't have this problem in our presentation." That is a claim
// with a number in it, and a claim with a number in it should have a test.
//
// The old pacing was a 15-minute timer plus the `focus` event. Both are desktop
// assumptions: fifteen minutes is a long time to stand in front of a room, and
// `focus` is not how a phone comes back — switching apps and returning to an
// installed PWA fires `visibilitychange`, and a bfcache restore fires `pageshow`
// and may fire nothing else at all.
//
// So this measures the promise rather than the mechanism:
//
//   1. a fresh load asks the server what build it is running, quickly;
//   2. a release that lands WHILE the app is open is on screen inside a minute;
//   3. coming back to the app checks immediately, by whichever event the device
//      happens to send — visibilitychange, pageshow or focus;
//   4. a hidden app costs nothing: no timer, no request;
//   5. events arriving together are one request, not three;
//   6. once it has found the update it stops asking.
//
// The service worker is blocked in these contexts, which is deliberate: it
// proves the server check stands on its own, the way it must on a device whose
// worker is the broken part.
