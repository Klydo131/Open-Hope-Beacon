// "The Install button does nothing on my iPhone."
//
// THE BUG. Safari has never fired `beforeinstallprompt`, on iOS or on macOS.
// So on every Apple device the header's Install chip has no prompt to hand the
// browser and falls back to a link. That link pointed at `/settings`, and the
// install card lives near the bottom of a long page.
//
// From the user's side: they press a button that says Install, Settings opens,
// and nothing that mentions installing is on screen. There is no error and
// nothing looks broken, so the reasonable conclusion is that the button does
// not work. Android users never saw this, because Chrome gives them a real
// one-tap prompt and they never take this branch.
//
// The fix is an anchor and an opened accordion, which is why this test checks
// where the link goes AND what is on screen after following it. Checking only
// the href would have passed before the accordion was opened, and the person
// would still be looking at a button instead of an answer.
//
