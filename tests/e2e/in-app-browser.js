// Opening a shared link from inside another app's browser.
//
// THE REPORTED BUG. A church shared the address in Messenger. Tapping it opens
// Messenger's OWN web view, which reports itself as an iPhone or iPad, is not
// standalone, and is on the right host — so every check said "offer the
// install" and the card printed "Tap Share at the bottom of Safari, choose Add
// to Home Screen".
//
// There is no Safari. On iOS no in-app browser can install anything; only
// Safari can. Apple users were handed steps that cannot be carried out, with
// nothing saying the browser was the problem, and concluded the app was broken.
//
// The controls that matter are the pair: the SAME page must give Safari
// instructions in Safari and refuse to in Messenger. One without the other
// proves nothing — a card that never mentions Safari would pass half of this.
