# End-to-end walks

Plain Node + Playwright. No framework, no config file — each suite is
`node <file> <port>` and exits non-zero when it fails.

They exist because four separate rounds of tutorial bugs were all found by a
person holding a phone rather than by anything automatic, and every one of them
had already survived a clean typecheck and a clean build. A screen can compile,
render, and still be a button that does nothing.

## Running them

Almost always, run the lot:

```bash
npm run test:all
```

That builds, starts the app on a free port, waits until the server answers with
the build id it just built, runs every suite, and tears the server down. The
wait matters: `next start` happily serves a stale process on a busy port, and a
suite that passes against yesterday's build is worse than no suite.

To run one on its own:

```bash
npm run build
npx next start -p 4002
node tests/e2e/tutorial-tut2.js 4002
```

**Every suite takes the port as `argv[2]`.** `tests/test-portability.mjs` fails
the build if one stops doing that — a hardcoded port produces a connection error
that reads exactly like the app being down, and that has cost real time twice.

## Playwright

Deliberately **not** a dependency: it is a ~300 MB install with its own browser
downloads, and the app does not use it at runtime. `_playwright.js` finds it
wherever it lives — a local devDependency, a global install — and says so
plainly when it is absent, rather than failing in a way that looks like a broken
test.

```bash
npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium
```

## What each one asserts

- **tutorial-tut2** — every step's spotlight is on screen, clear of the sticky
  header, not intersecting the panel at any of five sampled points, and
  `elementFromPoint` at its centre resolves to a real `[data-quest]` target. A
  ring drawn over an overlay that eats the tap is a failure, not a pass.
- **tutorial-repeat** — six consecutive runs in one persistent browser profile
  must follow a byte-identical route. Fresh contexts hide state accumulation;
  this is the one that caught the tutorial breaking on run 5, once a sample
  seeker ran out of journey stages.
- **tutorial-space** — advance a seeker by hand, run the tutorial, advance
  someone inside it, finish, and assert your own data came back exactly and the
  tutorial's changes did not leak into it.
- **quest-roles** — completes all four role walks at phone width. Each walk
  points at different screens, so this is four chances to find a step whose
  target no longer exists.
- **seeker-no-stage** — opens the seeker's screens and asserts no stage name
  appears anywhere, including inside a tutorial hint. This one is a product
  rule, not a UI detail: keep it passing.
- **header-layers** — after opening a header panel, is the middle of that panel
  the thing you would hit if you tapped there? See the note at the top of the
  file; this is the question `isVisible()` does not ask.
- **old-save** — a save written by an older version still opens. Written after a
  release crashed for everybody who had used the app before.
- **update-speed**, **update-reminder**, **update-flow** — the update path, from
  noticing a new build to restarting in place.

The rest cover individual screens and are named after them.

## update-flow needs two real builds

A mocked second build proves nothing, so this one runs in two phases against a
genuinely rebuilt app:

```bash
npm run build && npx next start -p 4001
node tests/e2e/update-flow.js 4001 install   # installs the worker, checks the panel
# stop the server, `npm run build` again, restart it
node tests/e2e/update-flow.js 4001 update    # the banner must now appear
```

It reuses one persistent profile across both phases on purpose — the update path
only exists for an app that is already installed.

## The rule these encode

**A test with a "keep going anyway" path will report success for the bug it
exists to catch.** An earlier version of the tutorial suite pressed "Skip this
step" whenever the highlighted element could not be clicked, and printed
`ALL OK` on a tutorial that was completely stuck.

If you add a suite: make it fail first. Break the thing it covers and watch it
go red. A test that has never failed is a comment with a run time.
