// One tap from the wrong browser into Safari.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. Apple permits only Safari to add an app to the iPhone home
// screen. That is not ours to change. What was ours was the distance between
// "you are in Chrome" and "you are in Safari", which was three written steps
// about a ••• menu whose position differs in every app that has one, and which
// people were failing at -- the reported version being "they switch to Safari
// and it is still not working", because switching meant opening Safari and
// retyping the address, which loses the invitation link they were on.
//
// iOS reads a URL beginning `x-safari-https://` as "open the rest in Safari".
// One tap, same page, nothing retyped.
//
// THE THREE PROPERTIES CHECKED HERE, and each one is a way this could ship
// broken while looking fine:
//
//   1. The button appears where it is true: Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera on
//      iOS, and in-app browsers on iOS.
//   2. It NEVER appears where it is false. Real Safari does not need it, and
//      Android must never be told to open Safari, which its phone does not
//      have. Android inside Messenger is the case that catches a careless fix,
//      because `inAppBrowser()` matches there too.
//   3. The written steps survive underneath it. The scheme is undocumented and
//      some in-app browsers refuse the handoff silently, so a tap that does
//      nothing must leave a person no worse off than before.

  // install button instead of any written steps, so the handoff was never on
  // the page to be found either way.
  //
  // A green check that cannot fail is worse than no check, because it is
  // believed. The Android rule lives in safariHandoffUrl's `isIos()` gate and
  // is checked at the source level in tests/ios-install.mjs, which CAN fail
  // when it is removed. Proving it here would need a signed-in session on a
  // page that renders the settings card, which no other e2e test needs.
