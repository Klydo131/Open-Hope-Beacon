// Feedback goes somewhere a person will read it.
//
// THE REPORT: "Feedback is not working, I am pretty sure some feedbacks are
// still stuck in the database since I haven't received any email feedbacks."
//
// Nothing was stuck, and the truth was worse. There was no feedback table, and
// `setFeedbackSink` was never called ANYWHERE in the app -- so every message
// went to the default sink in lib/backend/feedback.ts, which honestly saves to
// the sender's own browser and says so on screen. Every message people wrote is
// in `hope-beacon.feedback.local` on the phone that wrote it and has never
// crossed the network. None of it can be recovered centrally, because it was
// never centrally anywhere.
//
// The default is right for the open-source build: a church cloning this has no
// server on the first run, and a demo that silently drops feedback teaches
// everybody that feedback is pointless. What was missing was the other half.
//
// This checks the half that was missing, and that the half that was right is
// still there.
