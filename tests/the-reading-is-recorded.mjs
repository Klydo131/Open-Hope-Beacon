// A study is marked read by the person who read it, and their leaders can see how far they have got.
//
// THE ASK: "Can we add the progress bar that can be recorded by the EDs and
// Directors if the Explorer is really Reading the Lesson studies from the
// samples and the Guide made for the Explorer."
//
// THE WORD THAT DECIDED THE DESIGN IS "really". A bar is worth having only if
// its number is evidence, and there were two easy ways to build one that is
// not:
//
//   ONE. MARK IT READ WHEN IT APPEARS. `SeriesBody` renders every lesson of an
//   open series expanded at once, so opening a six-lesson series would record
//   six lessons read on a single tap. A Director would then be looking at a
//   measurement of a tap, presented as a measurement of reading.
//
//   TWO. LET A LEADER TICK IT OFF. The moment somebody other than the reader
//   can write a read, the bar stops answering "did they read it" and starts
//   answering "does someone say they did". The database refuses this, not just
//   the screen, because the screen is not where the refusal has to hold.
//
// So this file checks BOTH halves the way the study-permissions test does: the
// policy that actually refuses, and the screen that does not offer what would
// be refused. Two statements of one sentence in two languages is two things to
// change and one thing to forget.
//
//   node tests/the-reading-is-recorded.mjs
//
// Reads the migrations and the screens. Needs no database.
