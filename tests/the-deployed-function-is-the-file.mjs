// What runs at Supabase is this directory, byte for byte.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS NOT A TIDY-UP.
//
// The invite edge function is the only code in this project that does not reach
// production through git. Vercel builds the app from `main`; the edge function
// is deployed by SENDING ITS SOURCE INLINE, as JSON, in a tool call. Nothing
// about that path is checked by the build, by CI, or by any other file here.
//
// Two separate things have already gone wrong on it, and both were invisible
// from inside the repository:
//
//   1. A PLACEHOLDER WAS DEPLOYED BY MISTAKE. `// PLACEHOLDER` went live as
//      version 39 in place of forty thousand characters of index.ts. Every
//      invitation the church sent in that window failed. The repo was perfect
//      throughout; `npm run verify` was green throughout. Nothing in the
//      project could have told anybody.
//
//   2. THE TRANSPORT REWRITES THE SOURCE. Sending the files as JSON means a
//      JSON parser reads them, and a JSON parser DECODES BACKSLASH-U ESCAPES.
//      One escape in email.ts arrived at Supabase as the bare character it
//      stands for, and the deployed file was five characters shorter than the
//      file it came from.
//
// The second one was harmless where it landed -- the escape and the character
// are the same thing inside that character class. It is not harmless in
// general, and this is the case to keep in mind: an escape for a full stop
// inside a regular expression arrives as a bare dot, which matches ANY
// character. A pattern written to be strict is deployed permissive, the source
// still reads correctly, and there is nothing to see.
//
// So this file does the half that can be done offline: it forbids the escape,
// so the transport has nothing left to rewrite and the deployed bytes are the
// file's bytes.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT DO, SAID PLAINLY. It cannot see Supabase. A guardrail
// that runs in CI has no credentials and no network, so it cannot fetch the
// live function and compare. The comparison is real and it is what caught both
// faults, but it is a THING A PERSON RUNS, not a check that can go red on its
// own. `npm run verify` passing therefore never means "the deployed function is
// correct" -- it means "if it was deployed from these files, it is these
// files". The procedure for the other half is at the bottom of this file.

//
// Named rather than counted. A deploy sends a LIST, and a file added here but
// left off that list is not a build error -- it is an import of something that
// is not there, at runtime, on the first invitation somebody sends. So the
// three are written down, and adding a fourth has to be a deliberate edit to
// this line by somebody who has then also gone and looked at the deploy call.

// 2. NOTHING IN THE DIRECTORY SURVIVES THE TRIP AS SOMETHING ELSE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE ONE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR.
//
// A backslash-u escape is decoded by the JSON transport, so what is deployed is
// the character, not the escape. Write the character.
//
// This check must name the pattern to hunt for it, so it exempts itself -- the
// same exemption tests/no-backend.js takes, in its own words: "it must name
// them to find them". The exemption is by path, so it cannot silently widen.

      // The line numbers, because "email.ts has one" is not enough to go and
      // fix it and this check is read at the moment somebody is in a hurry.
      const lines = text.split('\n')
        .map((l, i) => (ESCAPE.test(l) ? i + 1 : null))
        .filter(Boolean);
      ESCAPE.lastIndex = 0;

     + 'nothing to decode'

            offenders.join('\n                                              ')}`
        : ''));
}

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 3. AND THE REASON IS WRITTEN DOWN WHERE IT WILL BE READ
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Check 2 goes red with a message, and a message is not a reason. Somebody
// meeting this for the first time will be holding a perfectly ordinary escape
// and a build that refuses it, and the honest question is "why on earth not".
// The answer belongs beside the line it constrains, not only in a test file
// they have no reason to open -- so email.ts carrying its own explanation is
// itself checked.
//
// DELETING THE EXPLANATION IS THE FAILURE THIS CATCHES. Not a missing word.

// THE OTHER HALF: COMPARING THE LIVE FUNCTION TO THIS DIRECTORY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// This cannot run here -- no credentials, no network. It is the check that
// caught the placeholder and the rewritten escape, so it is written down rather
// than remembered. RUN IT AFTER EVERY DEPLOY, without exception, because a
// deploy is the one change in this project that no automated gate can see.
//
//   1. Fetch the live function's files (Supabase MCP: get_edge_function, or
//      `supabase functions download invite`).
//   2. For each of the three, compare the live text to the file here. NOT a
//      length check and NOT a spot-read: sha256 both, or diff them.
//   3. Check the version number moved, and that the status is ACTIVE.
//
// A deploy that reports success has reported that the REQUEST was accepted. It
// has not told you what was in it. Version 39 returned success.
