// Somebody who signs in with things waiting is told.
//
// THE ASK: "make sure the notification notified the user once the user logs in
// or goes online when the user have notifications."
//
// It did not. The bell announced things that arrived WHILE somebody was already
// looking at the app, and deliberately said nothing on the first poll — which
// IS the sign-in moment, because the bell only mounts inside the signed-in
// shell. So the case that most needs a pop-up, opening the app to find a
// safeguarding report waiting, was the one case that never produced one.
//
// The silence had a real reason and it is kept: a quiet week fired ELEVEN
// separate pop-ups at once, and a person buried like that switches alerts off
// and then hears about nothing ever again. Silence is not the fix for eleven.
// One is.
//
// This runs the real decision. A browser here cannot help: pop-ups need a
// granted permission, a service worker and a device, and what would go wrong is
// a counting mistake nobody sees until a real person is buried or ignored.
