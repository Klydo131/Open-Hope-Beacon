// An Explorer must be able to see that their Guide is a real person.
//
// THE REPORT: "Explorer must see the Guide's profile and image please so that
// the explorer is aware of the Guide is not a robot but a real person."
//
// The Explorer's home screen said "Walking with you" and then a name on a line.
// Everything else on that screen is generated — the greeting, the stages, the
// notifications — so a name in the same typeface as the rest of it is not
// evidence of anybody. The whole product rests on the Explorer believing a
// person is reading what they write.
//
// THE SECOND HALF, and the reason this file exists rather than just a diff: a
// card that shows a person's details is one query away from showing too many of
// them. `pairedProfile` reads a Guide's row from an Explorer's browser, and the
// short column list is the only thing standing between that and a birthday.
// Row-level security decides WHICH row; nothing but this list decides which
// COLUMNS, so the list is checked here and a `select('*')` fails the build.
//
// WHY THE RULE IS ON THE SOURCE. This screen needs a database session the
// sandbox does not have, so it cannot be rendered. The failure is not a crash
// either: it is a screen that quietly goes back to two initials on a circle.
