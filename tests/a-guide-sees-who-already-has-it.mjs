// A Guide can see who already has a resource, without opening anything.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The chip that says "Maria has this" was on the row the whole
// time, fenced behind `pairings.length === 1`. So the only Guide it ever spoke
// to was one carrying a single Explorer. A Guide at the cap of five -- exactly
// the person who cannot hold it in their head -- saw nothing, and had to open
// the picker on every row in turn to answer "have I given them this yet".
//
// The answer was already in memory. `alreadyShared` is loaded for EVERY pairing
// on the screen, not just the first; the fence was the only thing stopping it
// being read. This is a condition removed, not a feature added, which is why
// the check below is about the condition.
//
// WHY THIS IS SAFE AND A CHURCH-WIDE COUNT IS NOT, since the two look alike.
// This is built from `listShares` per pairing, which reads through the
// `shares_read` policy -- `in_pairing(pairing_id)` -- so it can only ever
// contain pairings this person is part of. It is arithmetic on what the browser
// already fetched, not a new disclosure.
//
// A "shared 7 times across the church" badge would be different in kind.
// Migration 0008 states the boundary in its own words: a Director "is shown
// that a Guide is active, never what they sent to whom". In a church with two
// pairings, a Guide who shared something once and sees the count read two has
// learned what the other pairing received. That is the rule this file must not
// be quietly widened into breaking.
