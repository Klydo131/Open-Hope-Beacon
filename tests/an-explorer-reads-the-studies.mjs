// An Explorer reads the studies. Guides, Directors and Executive Directors write them.
//
// THE OWNER'S DECISION, IN THEIR WORDS: "for Explorers they cannot edit what
// the sample Lesson studies are, only EDs, Directors and Guides can do that...
// Explorers can only see all of the Lesson studies from the sample and what
// the guide provided."
//
// THIS NARROWS AN EARLIER INSTRUCTION, DELIBERATELY. `a_study_is_yours_to_change`
// opened writing to everybody, because the ask at the time was that everybody
// should keep their own edited copy. The owner has since narrowed it, which is
// theirs to decide and is the better shape: a study is teaching material, and
// the people who teach are Guides, Directors and Executive Directors. Somebody
// being walked with is not preparing the walk.
//
// TWO COPIES OF ONE RULE, WHICH IS THE RISK THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. The database
// refuses, and the screen declines to offer a button that would be refused.
// Those are two statements of the same sentence in two languages, and two
// things to change is one thing to forget. So this checks BOTH and checks they
// agree.
