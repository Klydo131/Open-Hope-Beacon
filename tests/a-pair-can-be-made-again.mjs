// Two people who were unpaired can be paired again.
//
// THE BUG, REPORTED FROM A PHONE. A Director disconnected two people, tried to
// pair them again, and got:
//
//   duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pairings_ds_id_dm_id_key"
//
// The constraint was UNIQUE (ds_id, dm_id) with no condition, and disconnecting
// does not delete the row — it archives it, deliberately, so the history of who
// walked with whom survives. Together those mean the archived row keeps that
// pair's slot forever: those two people can never be paired again, by anybody.
//
// Every disconnect this church had done was in that state — seven archived
// pairings, seven pairs that could not be remade. And "disconnect, then pair
// them again" is the obvious way to fix a pairing made by mistake, which is
// exactly when a Director reaches for it.
//
// THE SECOND BUG, FOUND WHILE FIXING THE FIRST. Nothing said an Explorer has
// ONE Guide: the only trigger caps a GUIDE at five Explorers, the other side of
// the relationship. Four Explorers had two Guides, and because getMyPairing
// read with `.maybeSingle()` — which raises on two rows — their My Guide screen
// failed outright rather than showing the wrong Guide.
//
//   node tests/a-pair-can-be-made-again.mjs
