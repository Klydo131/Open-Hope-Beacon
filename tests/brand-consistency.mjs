// seekers" on the Director's dashboard, "A missionary will be connected with you
// soon" on an Explorer's waiting screen, "Your missionary can study these with
// you" on the study shelf. The last of those survived TWO deliberate sweeps and
// was found by screenshotting the app for a client deck.
//
// The reason it keeps happening is that the retired words are also legitimate
// code: `role === 'admin'`, `/admin`, `is_admin()`, a `missionaries` count
// variable, `seekerPriorities`. So a plain grep either misses the copy or
// drowns in identifiers, and a person scanning the output makes the wrong call
// on the boundary.
//
// This checks only what a person can READ: JSX text between tags, and quoted
// strings that contain a space (so `'admin'` is a value and "A Director will
// approve you" is a sentence). It is deliberately narrow — it would rather miss
// an exotic case than cry wolf and be switched off.
