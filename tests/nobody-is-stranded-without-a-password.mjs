// Being invited must end in a password, or the account is a locked door.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE PROBLEM. An invitation creates the auth account the moment
// it is SENT, not when the person arrives. So somebody whose one-time link is
// spent before they reach the password step has a real account, a real row, a
// real "has an account" tick on the Director's screen — and no password, and
// therefore no way in. Twenty-three people were in exactly that state at once:
// seven Directors, seven Guides, nine Explorers.
//
// The usual cause was the old email order. They followed the install steps
// first, the installed app opened as a fresh session with no invitation in it,
// and the link was gone by the time they came back. Reordering the email fixes
// it going forward and does nothing for anybody already stranded.
//
// TWO WAYS OUT, ONE FROM EACH SIDE, and this checks both exist:
//   the person   — offered at the moment their sign-in is refused, in words
//                  that describe never having had a password rather than
//                  having forgotten one;
//   the Director — one button for the whole backlog, rather than finding the
//                  unfinished rows by eye and pressing Re-send on each.
