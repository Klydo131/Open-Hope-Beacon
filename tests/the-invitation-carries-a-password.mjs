// The invitation carries an account somebody can sign in to, not a link that dies.
//
// WHAT WAS ASKED FOR. "We can make the email invitation have a faster process.
// How about we make the invitation with account with password already... That
// email and password must be emphasized first before tapping the accept or join
// in to the Web app. Once the user read the email and password, they are ready
// to tap or click the app."
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES, AND WHY IT IS THE RIGHT TRADE. `auth.users` holds ONE
// confirmation token and ONE recovery token -- single slots, not a list. Every
// path that minted a second token silently killed the one already sitting in
// somebody's inbox. On top of that, a one-time link is spent by whatever opens
// it first, which on most mail systems is a scanner rather than a person, and
// it expires on a clock nobody invited to a church app knows about. Twenty-three
// people were stuck at once, each holding an account with no password and a
// link that had already been used.
//
// A password has none of those failure modes. It does not expire, is not
// consumed by being read, survives being forwarded and tapped twice, and can be
// read aloud to somebody helping an older member get set up.
//
// THE COST, WHICH IS REAL. Anybody who can read that inbox can sign in, and it
// stays true until the password is changed. The answer is the wording in the
// email, a place in the app to change it, and a reminder that keeps asking --
// all three checked below, because the trade is only defensible if all three
// actually exist.

// is on the door rather than on anything role-shaped.
//
// THE FRAGMENT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT. Everything after `#` is stripped
// by the browser before the request is built: not in the address the server
// receives, not in an access log, not in a proxy's records, not in a Referer
// header handed to anything the page later loads. A `?p=` would be in all five,
// and would be the kind of mistake that is invisible until somebody reads a log
// a year later. This checks the fragment is used AND that a query parameter

  // THE FALLBACK ADDRESS MOVED TO THE PLAIN-TEXT PART, and the rule it was
  // protecting still holds there. The HTML used to print the address a second
  // time under the button; that duplicated a link and, with everything else,
  // helped put the first real invitation in Gmail's Promotions tab. What must
  // never happen either way is the PASSWORD appearing inside a printed address:
  // somebody copying that line into a chat to ask for help would paste their
  // password with it.
