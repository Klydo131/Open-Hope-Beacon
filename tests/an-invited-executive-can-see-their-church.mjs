// An Executive Director who was invited can see the church they were invited to.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// REPORTED AS "I dont see the names when it comes to pairing", from a phone and
// then, when that was not it, from a laptop. The Guide picker opened with one
// row in it, "Choose guide", and no people.
//
// The people were there: forty-two approved Guides and forty-five approved
// Explorers. What was missing was the reader's permission to see any of them.
// Measured by running the real policies as each Executive Director in turn:
//
//     four executives  ->  109 profiles readable, 42 guides, 45 explorers
//     two executives   ->    1 profile readable,   0 guides,  0 explorers
//
// One profile is their own. Those two were not looking at a broken dropdown.
// They were looking at an app with nobody in it, on every screen.
//
// WHY, AND WHY IT IS A DATABASE TEST AND NOT A SCREEN ONE. For an Executive
// Director `manages_church(c)` rests entirely on `oversees_church(c)`, a lookup
// in `church_executives`; `is_admin()` is false for them by definition, so
// their `profiles.church_id` grants them nothing. `create_church()` inserts
// that row for whoever calls it. `handle_new_user` never did -- so an executive
// who CREATES a church works and an executive who is INVITED into one is blind.
//
// THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THE SHAPE HAS BEEN FIXED. Migration 0025 records two
// of them in its own header: `discipline_check` "silently refused them on every
// member of a church they are responsible for", and before that "the same fault
// that made executives see one profile instead of twenty-four, in a different
// function". Both were repaired where they were found, the missing row was not,
// and it surfaced a third time in the pairing form. So this checks the CAUSE --
// that nothing can create an executive without the link -- rather than the
// third symptom.
//
//   node tests/an-invited-executive-can-see-their-church.mjs
//
// Reads the migration, because this sandbox has no database of its own. What
// the live database actually does was verified separately, by promoting a
// member and by signing an invited executive up inside a rolled-back
// transaction: both produced the link, and the probe left nothing behind.

// anybody who is not already one, and a trigger stops a profile changing its
// own role. If either of those went, this trigger would turn a self-assigned role
// into real oversight, so they are checked here beside it.

  // 0003_invite_approval_gate.sql. A check on a filename would have gone green
  // the day somebody renamed the file and red the day they did nothing wrong.

// 4. THE TRIGGER DOES NOT TAKE AUTHORITY AWAY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// An Executive Director may oversee SEVERAL churches -- that is what the table
// is for. A trigger that deleted rows on demotion would throw away assignments
// it never made and cannot recreate. It is safe to leave them because
// `oversees_church` demands `is_executive()` as well as the row, so a stale
// link on somebody who is no longer an executive grants nothing at all.
