// WHAT THIS IS. Type a colon and two letters -- `:pra` -- and the matches
// appear above the box. Asked for as "integrated with smart typing" rather than
// as a button, which is the better shape: a grid of four hundred pictures is a
// thing to go hunting in, and the point is to stay in the sentence.
//
// THE TRIGGER HAS TO BE NARROW, AND THIS APP MAKES THAT SHARPER THAN USUAL.
// A colon is punctuation people already type, so a loose rule fires constantly
// in the middle of ordinary writing. The false positive that matters most here
// is a VERSE REFERENCE: `Luke 4:18` must never open a menu. `10:30` and
// `https://` are the same rule and equally unwelcome.
//
// AND NOTHING IS EVER SUGGESTED UNASKED. The obvious "smarter" version watches
// ordinary words and offers a folded-hands when somebody types "pray". That
// would be wrong here and the reason belongs in a test rather than only in a
// comment: this box is where somebody tells their Guide about an illness, a
// marriage in trouble, a bereavement. An app that pops a cheerful picture up
// beside those words has made a joke of them. A colon is a deliberate act.
//
// EVERY CHARACTER IS A REAL EMOJI, and components/Glyph.tsx is why: the
// sign-out button was once an empty tofu box on every Android phone because it
// used a character from Miscellaneous Technical that LOOKS like an emoji. That
// is invisible on the machine this was written on, so it is checked here.
