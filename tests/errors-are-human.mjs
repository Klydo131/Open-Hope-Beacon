// A person is never shown Postgres.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, on a Guide's own screen, on a phone:
//
//     permission denied for table pairings
//     permission denied for function blog_feed
//
// printed in red where the church's pairings and Community Blogs should have
// been, under that Guide's own name and their reminders. And in a conversation:
//
//     mime type application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml
//     .document is not supported
//
// after attaching a study sheet.
//
// Every one of those is the database or the storage layer talking to itself.
// None of them names anything the reader can do. The first two do not even mean
// what they appear to mean: `pairings` grants SELECT to `authenticated` and
// nothing to `anon`, so "permission denied for table" is Postgres saying the
// request arrived as NOBODY — a signed-out session, not a rule anybody broke.
// Reported as a permission problem it sends a Director looking for a setting
// that does not exist.
//
// This runs the shipped translator over the real strings. It is a pure
// function, so the check is the function itself and not a copy of it.
