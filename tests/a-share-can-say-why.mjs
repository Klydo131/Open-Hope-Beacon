// A Guide can say why they are sending something.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every part of this feature was built except the one that
// takes the input, and nothing noticed for as long as it shipped:
//
//   material_shares.note    the column, capped at 1000  -- migration 0008
//   shareMaterial(..., note)  the data layer takes one  -- lib/live/data.ts
//   {s.note && <span>"{s.note}"</span>}  the Explorer's card DRAWS it
//   live.shareMaterial(m.id, p.id)       the Guide's screen never passed it
//
// So every share ever written carried an empty note. Not because Guides
// skipped it -- because there was no box. The receiving half of the feature had
// been rendering a field that could not be filled, which is the kind of fault
// that never produces an error and never appears in a log. It was found by
// counting: twenty-two shares in the church, twenty-two empty notes.
//
// AND IT IS THE PART THAT CARRIES THE MEANING. "Here is a link" and "watch the
// first ten minutes before Thursday, it is the bit we got stuck on" are the
// same row in the database and not remotely the same thing to receive. A
// discipleship app that drops the second one is a bookmark list.
//

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//

// four were already true while the feature did nothing. The link that was
// missing is the one between the screen and the data layer, so that is the one
// stated first and most plainly.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 2. THERE IS SOMEWHERE TO TYPE IT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The check that would have caught the original fault. A handler that accepts
// a note is worth nothing if no control ever produces one, which is exactly
// the state this replaces.

     + 'and not by an error after the tap');

  // A LABEL, BECAUSE A BARE BOX IS A GUESS. Screen readers get nothing from a
  // placeholder; it is not a label and disappears as soon as anybody types.

}

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 3. THE NOTE DOES NOT FOLLOW YOU TO THE NEXT RESOURCE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE BUG THIS SHAPE INVITES, written down so the fix is not undone. One note
// for the whole picker means one piece of state for the whole screen, and state
// that outlives the row it was typed on would attach "watch the first ten
// minutes" to somebody else's completely different link -- a wrong sentence in
// a real person's hands, with the Guide's name on it.
//
// So it is cleared on OPEN as well as on close. Clearing only on close leaves
// it behind whenever the picker is abandoned by opening another row.

  ok(/setSharing\(m\.id\);[^}]*setShareNote\(''\)/.test(lib),
     'opening a row starts with an empty note');

     'and closing the picker clears it too');
}

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 4. IT IS OPTIONAL, AND SHARING STILL COSTS TWO TAPS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The rule the add form already states in its own words: making it required
// would stop somebody sharing a link they are in a hurry about, and a link with
// no note still beats no link. If this ever becomes required, this check is
// where the argument should be had.
