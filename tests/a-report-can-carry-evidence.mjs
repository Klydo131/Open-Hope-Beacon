// A safeguarding report can carry the thing being reported.
//
// WHAT WAS MISSING. A report held a reason and a paragraph of text. The thing
// being reported is very often a picture, a screenshot of a conversation, a
// voice note or a document — and the person holding it on their phone was asked
// to describe it in words, and a Director then decided on that description
// alone.
//
// THE AUTHORISATION IS THE POINT, and it is narrower than anything else in this
// bucket. Lesson handouts and avatars are readable across a church because they
// are meant to be; evidence is not. It matches `reports_read` exactly — the
// Directors and Executive Directors of that church — which means, deliberately,
// that it is kept from the person who raised the report too. There is no "my
// reports" view anywhere in this app; attaching must not create one.
//
// AND THERE IS NO DELETE, for the row or the object. `reports` has no delete
// policy on purpose: a record somebody can remove is not a record.
//
