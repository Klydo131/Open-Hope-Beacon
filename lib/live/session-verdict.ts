// What a failed load means for somebody's session.
//
// THE BUG: "Some of the users still experiencing getting log out when they tab
// out to another web page or they exit the browser."
//
// Three things had to be wrong at once, and they were:
//
//   1. The question was asked of the ERROR MESSAGE. The old test was
//      /jwt|expired|invalid|refresh token|not authenticated/ against whatever
//      string came back, and `invalid` and `expired` are ordinary words. A
//      routine database complaint like "invalid input syntax for type uuid"
//      ended the session. So did every "JWT expired" that was really a phone
//      whose radio had not come back yet: the refresh could not leave the
//      device, the stale token went instead, and the server said the only
//      thing it could say.
//
//   2. A WAKE-UP READ COULD MAKE THINGS WORSE. Coming back to the tab re-reads
//      the profile. If that failed for any reason it threw away the profile
//      already loaded and drew "Your account is not ready" over a Sign out
//      button, which from where the person is standing is being logged out.
//
//   3. Nothing retried. The screen stayed like that until the person tapped
//      something, and the one thing they will not tap is a screen that has just
//      told them their account is not ready.
//
// THE FIX IS TO ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION. Whether a session is over is already
// decided, properly, in exactly one place: lib/supabase/client.ts clears the
// stored session when the SERVER refuses the refresh, and deliberately does not
// when the request never got there. So the only thing worth knowing here is
// whether that decision has been made. The error text is not evidence.
//
// Kept out of the provider so it can be run rather than read. The failure it
// prevents needs a real token, a real hour and a flaky real network to
// reproduce, so a browser test cannot reach it; this can.
