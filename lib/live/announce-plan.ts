// What to pop up, given what is waiting.
//
// THE ASK: "make sure the notification notified the user once the user logs in
// or goes online when the user have notifications."
//
// It did not. The bell announced things that arrived WHILE somebody was already
// looking at the app, and deliberately said nothing on the first poll — which
// is the sign-in moment, because the bell only mounts inside the signed-in
// shell. So the one case that most needs a pop-up, arriving to find a
// safeguarding report waiting, was the one case that never got one.
//
// The reason for that silence was real and is kept: opening the app after a
// quiet week fired ELEVEN separate pop-ups at once, and somebody buried like
// that switches alerts off and then hears about nothing ever again. But silence
// is not the fix for eleven. One is.
//
// Kept out of the component so it can be run. The failure mode here is a
// counting mistake nobody sees until a real person is buried or ignored.
