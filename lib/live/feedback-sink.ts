// Feedback, sent to the church rather than kept on the phone.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR: "Feedback is not working, I am pretty sure some
// feedbacks are still stuck in the database since I haven't received any email
// feedbacks."
//
// Nothing was stuck. `setFeedbackSink` was never called, anywhere, so every
// message went to the DEFAULT sink in lib/backend/feedback.ts -- which saves to
// the sender's own browser and says so honestly on screen. There was no
// feedback table to be stuck in. Each message is still sitting in
// `hope-beacon.feedback.local` on the phone of whoever wrote it and has never
// crossed the network.
//
// The default is right for the open-source build: a church cloning this has no
// server on the first run, and a demo that silently drops feedback teaches
// everybody that feedback is pointless. What was missing is this half -- the
// sink for a church that HAS a database.
//
// WHY NOT EMAIL, since email is what was expected. The built-in mailer sends
// about two messages an hour for the whole project, so feedback routed through
// it would be dropped on exactly the days worth hearing about. A row arrives
// instantly, cannot be rate limited, and is read by whoever can act on it.
