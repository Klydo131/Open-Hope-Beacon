// Emoji, suggested while you type, rather than hunted for in a grid.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THIS IS. Type a colon and a couple of letters -- `:pra` -- and the
// matches appear above the box. Pick one and it replaces what you typed. The
// same pattern people already know from every tool that has it, and the reason
// it was asked for as "integrated with smart typing" rather than as a button.
//
// WHY A COLON, AND NOT SUGGESTING ON ORDINARY WORDS. The obvious "smarter"
// version watches what somebody writes and offers an emoji for it -- type
// "pray" and be offered a folded-hands. That would be wrong HERE, and it is
// worth saying why rather than leaving it as a taste. This box is where
// somebody tells their Guide about an illness, a marriage in trouble, a
// bereavement. An app that pops a cheerful picture up beside those words has
// made a joke of them. A colon is a deliberate act: nothing is ever suggested
// to somebody who did not ask, in the middle of the hardest sentence they will
// write this year.
//
// EVERY ENTRY IS A REAL EMOJI, AND components/Glyph.tsx IS WHY. The sign-out
// button was once an empty box on every Android phone, because it used U+23FB
// from Miscellaneous Technical -- a character that LOOKS like an emoji and is
// not one, so no font promises to draw it. Emoji proper are safe: every phone
// ships a colour emoji font covering the set. So nothing from a symbol block
// gets in here, and the few characters that default to TEXT presentation carry
// an explicit U+FE0F variation selector to ask for the colour glyph. The test
// checks both, because tofu is invisible on the machine this was written on.
//
// THE LIST IS DELIBERATELY SMALL AND DELIBERATELY PLAIN. It is a church
// directory, not a keyboard: no drink, no gestures that are rude in the
// Philippines or anywhere else, nothing that could combine into a sentence
// somebody would be embarrassed to have read out. The same rule the invitation
// word list states in its own file. A phone keyboard still has every emoji
// there is for anybody who wants one -- this is a shortcut, not a gate.

// EVERY ENTRY CARRIES U+FE0F, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE OVER-APPLICATION.
//
// A variation selector asks for the colour glyph. Some characters need it --
// they default to a monochrome TEXT shape without one -- and some already
// default to colour, where it does nothing at all.
//
// The tempting rule is "add it only where it is needed", and the first version
// of this file used it: anything below U+1F000. That rule is WRONG, and wrong
// in the direction that does not show up on the machine it was written on. The
// dove U+1F54A and the rain cloud U+1F327 are both well above U+1F000 and both
// default to text presentation, so the tidy rule stripped the selector from
// exactly the two entries that could not do without it.
//
// Knowing which characters need it means carrying a copy of Unicode's
// Emoji_Presentation data, which is a dependency and a thing to keep current.
// Adding it everywhere is a no-op where it is not needed and correct where it
// is, and the rule is then simple enough to actually check: every entry ends
// with it. Cheap beats clever when the failure mode is invisible.
//
// AND ONE CANDIDATE WAS DROPPED
// rather than kept. The alarm clock U+23F0 is a perfectly real emoji -- and it
// lives in Miscellaneous Technical, the same block as the U+23FB that drew an
// empty box on every Android phone. The guardrail that catches that block is
// deliberately blunt, because the distinction is precisely the one nobody can
// see while writing the code on a machine that renders both. A clock is not
// worth teaching it an exception, so there is no clock; the calendar carries
// arranging a time.
