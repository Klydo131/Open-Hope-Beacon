// THE TUTORIAL IS NOT PART OF THE LIVE APP. This file is what keeps that true.
//
// There are two separate things in this repository and they share nothing but
// the screens they are drawn on:
//
//   THE LIVE APP     real people, real database, invitation only. Every row it
//                    shows came from Postgres and passed a security policy.
//   THE TUTORIAL     sample people invented in the browser. No database, no
//                    account, no network. Works on a plane. Nothing typed into
//                    it is ever sent anywhere.
//
// A visitor must be able to try the second one WITHOUT touching the first —
// that is the whole point of having it. Before this file existed there was no
// way to: lib/mode.ts decides live-or-demo from whether Supabase keys are
// present at build time, so on a deployed church app IS_LIVE was permanently
// true and the tutorial, though compiled into the bundle, was unreachable. The
// front door offered "Sign in" and "I have an invitation" and nothing else, so
// somebody evaluating the app had no way in at all.
//
// The fix people usually reach for is worse: let the sample accounts sign in to
// the real database. That is not a tutorial, it is seeding a church's live
// database with invented members, and the moment the seed is not run the
// sign-in fails in a way that reads like the app is broken.
//
// So the choice is made HERE, at runtime, per visitor, and it only ever moves
// in the safe direction:
//
//   - a deployment with no database can only ever be the tutorial
//   - a deployment WITH one is live, unless this visitor asked for the tutorial
//
// Asking cannot enable a database that isn't configured, and being in the
// tutorial cannot read one that is: the demo screens talk to lib/demo/store,
// which has no network code in it at all.
