// Unsent messages survive leaving the screen.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. You start writing to somebody, get interrupted, and go and look
// at a lesson — or your phone locks, or the browser drops the tab to save
// memory, which phones do constantly. When you come back, what you had written
// is still in the box. Delete it all and the draft goes with it, so an empty box
// stays empty and nothing lingers to surprise you next time.
//
// WHY IT NEVER LEAVES THE DEVICE. A draft is the most private thing in this
// app. It is a half-finished thought, often the hardest one somebody has tried
// to put into words, and frequently it is deleted rather than sent — that
// deletion is a decision, and it has to be real. So drafts live in this
// browser's own storage and are never written to the database, never sent to
// the church, and never readable by a Guide, a Director or anybody else. There
// is deliberately no server side to this file.
//
// ONE DRAFT PER CONVERSATION, and the key is what makes that safe. Every draft
// is stored under the pairing it belongs to. A single shared key would be a
// genuine privacy incident in an app like this one: half a message meant for one
// Explorer would appear in the box open to another.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. Stale drafts are not pruned. A pairing that gets archived
// leaves its draft behind, forever, in that one browser. It is a few hundred
// bytes of the person's own words on their own device, and the alternative —
// timestamps, an expiry sweep, a migration when the shape changes — is more
// moving parts than the problem deserves.

 *
 * `key` may be null, and often is — the Explorer's own page does not know which
 * pairing it is showing until the pairing has loaded, so the first render has
 * nothing to key on. While it is null the box behaves as an ordinary unsaved
 * one, and the moment the id arrives the draft appears.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS SHAPE EXISTS TO PREVENT. The obvious version keeps the text in
 * one piece of state and the key in another, and then for one render after the
 * key changes the state holds the OLD conversation's text alongside the NEW
 * conversation's key — long enough to save one person's words under another
 * person's name. So the text and the key it belongs to are stored together and
 * moved together, and a mismatch reads as empty rather than as somebody else's
