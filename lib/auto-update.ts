// When is it safe to reload the app out from under somebody?
//
// Pulled out of components/AutoUpdate so it can be exercised directly. The
// end-to-end suite can prove the app does NOT reload while a message is
// half-written, but it cannot reliably prove the opposite half — that a cleared
// box lets the update through — because that needs a genuinely newer service
// worker waiting, which a single-build test harness does not have.
//
// A test that only ever demonstrates the blocking case would pass just as
// happily on a guard that blocks FOREVER, which is a real bug wearing the
// costume of a working one. So the decision lives here, in a function with no
// timers and no side effects, and both answers get asserted.

/**
 * Is somebody in the middle of writing something?
 *
 * Two questions, not one. The focused element says where the cursor is; the
 * sweep says whether anything on the page holds text that has not been sent.
 * Somebody who typed half a message and then tapped away to check a name still
 * has a half-written message.
 *
 * Deliberately generous about what counts as in use: a search box with a word in
 * it blocks the update too. The cost of waiting is a few more minutes on an old
 * build. The cost of being wrong the other way is somebody's words.

/**
 * The whole policy, in one expression.
 *
 * Backgrounded: nothing on screen to interrupt, so apply at once. Foreground:
 * only when the page has been quiet AND nothing is half-written. Both halves
 * matter — a person can stop typing mid-sentence to think, and their words are
 * still theirs.
 *
 * There is deliberately no timeout that eventually overrides `unsaved`. A build
 * being an hour older is a smaller problem than a lost message, every time, and
 * a guard with an escape hatch fires on exactly the worst case.
 *
 * THE BUDGET IS NOT A REFINEMENT. It is the difference between an app and a
 * brick. Applying an update means reloading, and the app decides to reload by
 * comparing the id the server publishes with the id compiled into the bundle it
 * is running. Those two can disagree in ways no reload will fix — an edge cache
 * serving `/version.json` from one deployment and the HTML from another, a
 * half-rolled-out release, a worker that will not install. This project has
 * already shipped a build where the two ids disagreed permanently.
 *
 * With a banner, that state was a prompt that never went away. With automatic
 * apply, it is an infinite reload loop: the app never finishes loading, so
 * nobody can reach Settings to escape it. Seen for real in
 * tests/e2e/update-speed.js, which had to be told about the budget before it
 * could stop measuring a page that was reloading under it.
 *
 * So: reload for a given build at most `maxAttempts` times, then stop and stay
 * usable on the old build. An old build is a small problem. A phone that will
 * not stay on screen is the end of somebody trusting the app.
