// Notice when the address changes, including when React cannot.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR: a Director standing on `/admin?room=pairings`
// presses "Waiting to be approved" on their desk. It links to
// `/admin?room=approvals`. Same page, same component, so nothing unmounts and
// nothing re-renders — the address in the bar changes and the screen does not.
// The desk rail is drawn ON the admin page, so this is not an edge case; it is
// the most likely press there is. It reads exactly as reported: "I click it and
// it doesn't go to the feature."
//
// Next's App Router gives no hook for this. `usePathname()` does not change,
// because the path did not. `useSearchParams()` does, but it forces a Suspense
// boundary onto every statically rendered page that touches it, which is a
// large change to make for a query string. `popstate` covers the back button
// only — the browser does not fire it, or `hashchange`, for a pushState.
//
// So: wrap pushState and replaceState once, and say so out loud. Roughly thirty
// lines, and every `?room=` and `#card` link in the app becomes reliable
// regardless of which screen somebody presses it from.
