// in it: every figure was a total since the beginning, plus one number for the

// church council actually asks, which is never "how many messages have ever been
// sent" but "are we doing more of this than we were, or less".
//
// So this is the shape of the answer: buckets of equal length, in order, ending
// with the one happening now. Pure functions over events, no React and no
// storage, so the same numbers can be drawn on a screen, read out in a meeting
// or checked by a test without any of them disagreeing.
