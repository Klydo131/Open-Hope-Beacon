// What an Apple device calls the thing everybody else calls Install.
//
// THE ASK, from the owner: "Do not put Install when it is Safari or the device
// is made by Apple. Install is too misleading for Apple users."
//
// They are right, and the code already half knew it. InstallPrompt carries the
// note "Apple has no programmatic install, so Install now cannot install", and
// the button was labelled Install anyway. On an iPhone or iPad the control is
// called Add to Home Screen; on a Mac it is Add to Dock. Neither menu contains
// the word Install anywhere, so somebody told to press Install goes looking
// through a Share sheet for a word that is not in it, and concludes the app is
// broken rather than that the instruction was wrong.
//
// THE THREE ARE NOT ONE. An iPhone and an iPad were treated as a single case
// and they are not: the Share button is at the BOTTOM of Safari on an iPhone
// and at the TOP, in the toolbar, on an iPad. A Mac has no Share button in the
// steps at all, it has a menu bar. So they get three sets of words.

// NO IMPORTS ON PURPOSE. This module is pure so a plain Node test can run it
// against real user-agent strings, and an import of the brand constants would
// drag in the `@/` alias that only the bundler understands. The app's name is
// passed in by the caller, which also keeps it in the one place brand.ts asks
// for it to live.
