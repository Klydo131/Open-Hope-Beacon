// shared feed shows NO individual seeker's private journey. A milestone is
// celebrated in the aggregate — "someone reached the Care stage" — never "John
// reached Care". A seeker glancing at the billboard learns the church is moving,
// not who is where. Anything that needs a name to be useful (a new sign-up to
// vouch for, an approval to grant) is not in the shared feed at all; it lives in
// the privileged strip below, which only Admin and Executive ever see, and only
// because acting on it is their job.
