// Where feedback goes — and the one place this app talks to a server.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE POINT OF THE PROJECT, so it is worth reading even if you skip
// everything else.
//
// Open Hope Beacon has no backend. Every screen runs from a store in the
// browser, so the app installs, works offline and demonstrates itself with no
// account, no database and no configuration. That is deliberate: a church should
// be able to try the whole thing before deciding anything.
//
// But a real deployment needs somewhere for a member's message to actually go.
// Rather than pick a provider for you — Supabase, Firebase, a mailbox, a
// spreadsheet, a self-hosted API — the app asks a SINK. The default one keeps
// everything on the device. Swap it for your own in one call and nothing else in
// the app changes.
//
//     // app/providers.tsx, or anywhere that runs once at startup
//     import { setFeedbackSink } from '@/lib/backend/feedback';
//
//     setFeedbackSink({
//       async send(message) {
//         const res = await fetch('https://your-church.example/feedback', {
//           method: 'POST',
//           headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
//           body: JSON.stringify(message),
//         });
//         return { ok: res.ok };
//       },
//     });
//
// THREE RULES FOR ANY SINK YOU WRITE, each one learned the expensive way:
//
//   1. NEVER THROW. A message a person took the trouble to write must not be
//      lost because a network was down. Return { ok: false } and the app keeps
//      it on the device to try again.
//   2. NEVER PUT A SECRET IN HERE. This file ships to the browser. An API key in
//      a sink is an API key published to every visitor. Put the key on your own
//      server and let the browser talk to that.
//   3. RATE LIMIT ON YOUR SERVER, not here. Anything in the browser can be
//      skipped by anybody who opens the network tab.
