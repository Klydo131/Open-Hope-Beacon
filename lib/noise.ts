// Ambient sound, generated rather than downloaded.
//
// WHY NOT AUDIO FILES. An hour of white noise is tens of megabytes. Serving it
// to a congregation would cost real egress every time somebody pressed play,
// on a project whose whole point is running for nothing, and it would not work
// on the bus. Generated noise is a few lines of arithmetic: no file, no
// bandwidth, no network, and it never ends because there is nothing to end.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT, reported by the people using it: "some of it are not
// pleasing." Three things were true at once, and each one is fixed below.
//
//   1. ALL THREE OPTIONS WERE NOISE, and one of them was raw white noise --
//      flat all the way up, which is the harshest thing a speaker can make and
//      the sound most people mean when they say noise is unpleasant. It sat in
//      the same undifferentiated list as the gentle ones, so somebody looking
//      for something calming had a one-in-three chance of an ear full of hiss.
//
//   2. NOTHING MOVED. A buffer looped forever at one level is a wall. What the
//      ear finds restful about rain and surf is that they swell and fall; a
//      static hiss at a fixed volume is fatiguing within minutes, and no amount
//      of choosing the right colour fixes that.
//
//   3. THE APP KNEW WHAT EACH ONE SOUNDED LIKE AND NEVER SAID. Every entry has
//      carried a `blurb` since the day it was written and no screen has ever
//      drawn one. The information that would have let somebody avoid the harsh
//      one was sitting in this file, unused.
//
// THE COLOURS, and they are not decoration. White is flat and harsh and masks
// speech best. Pink falls 3dB per octave, which is roughly how rain and wind
// actually sound, and is what most people mean by "white noise". Brown falls
// 6dB and reads as distant surf.
