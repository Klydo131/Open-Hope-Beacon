-- Editing and taking back in the Guides' room, and a delete that stops
-- destroying the thing it removes.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT WAS ALREADY HERE, AND WHY IT WAS THE WRONG SHAPE.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Unlike the Explorer conversation, this room COULD already delete:
-- `guide_room_drop` permits the author or church leadership. Three things were
-- wrong with it, and only the first is the feature that was asked for.
--
--   1. NO EDITING AT ALL. There is no UPDATE policy, so a typo stood for good
--      or the whole message had to be destroyed and written again.
--
--   2. THE DELETE DESTROYED THE RECORD. A real `delete from`, so the words were
--      gone from the database entirely. This is the room where Guides say the
--      hard parts of carrying people out loud, and leadership is in it. If a
--      safeguarding question is ever asked about something said here, "it was
--      deleted" has to mean "removed from the screen", not "removed from
--      existence" -- the rule this project wrote after the Guild Room shipped
--      without it, and applied to the Explorer conversation yesterday.
--
--   3. IT LEFT A GAP. Nothing marked that anything had been there, so a thread
--      somebody had read changed shape between visits with no explanation. In a
--      room where leadership can remove somebody else's words, a silent gap is
--      the worst possible rendering: the author is not told, and the others
--      cannot tell the difference between a message that was removed and one
--      they misremember.
--
-- So the delete becomes a soft one, through a function, and the hard-delete
-- policy goes. Leadership keeps exactly the power it had -- it is simply
-- recorded now.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- A separate table from `message_revisions` rather than a shared one. That
-- table's foreign keys are `messages(id)` and `pairings(id)`; making it serve
-- both rooms would mean nullable keys and a "which room is this" column, which
-- is how a record that must be exact becomes a record nobody can query
-- confidently. Two small honest tables beat one clever one.
