-- An Explorer reads the studies. They do not write them.
--
-- THE OWNER'S DECISION, IN THEIR WORDS: "for Explorers they cannot edit what
-- the sample Lesson studies are, only EDs, Directors and Guides can do that...
-- Explorers can only see all of the Lesson studies from the sample and what
-- the guide provided."
--
-- THIS REVERSES PART OF `a_study_is_yours_to_change`, DELIBERATELY. That
-- migration widened writing to everybody, on an earlier instruction that
-- everybody should be able to keep their own edited copy. The owner has
-- narrowed it, which is theirs to decide and is the better shape for this app:
-- a study is teaching material, and the people who teach are Guides, Directors
-- and Executive Directors. An Explorer is being walked with, not preparing the
-- walk.
--
-- WHAT AN EXPLORER KEEPS. Everything they had for reading: every published
-- study in their church, and anything a Guide shares with them. `ls_read` and
-- `lessons_read` are untouched below, on purpose -- the narrowing is on the
-- three writing verbs only.
--
-- WHAT THE COPY-ON-FIRST-EDIT MACHINERY IS FOR NOW. It stays, and it still
-- matters: a Guide correcting a church sample gets their own copy rather than
-- rewriting it for the other forty Guides. Only the set of people who can
-- start that has changed.
--
-- THE SCREEN IS NOT THE BOUNDARY. components/LiveStudies.tsx stops drawing the
-- controls in the same commit, and that is a convenience -- somebody should not
-- be offered a button that will refuse them. These policies are what actually
-- refuses, and they refuse a request that never went near a screen.

begin;

-- One place that answers "may this person write teaching material?", so the six
-- policies below cannot drift apart from one another.
