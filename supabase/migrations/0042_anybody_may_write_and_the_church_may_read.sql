-- Blogs everyone can actually publish.
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG. Writing was limited to Guides, Directors and Executive
-- Directors, so an Explorer who opened "Your blog", typed a post and pressed
-- publish got `new row violates row-level security policy for table
-- "blog_posts"`. The screen offered them something the database refused. That
-- is the worst shape a permission can take: not a locked door, a door drawn on
-- a wall.
--
-- And the only church-wide audience was a leader's. A post by anybody else
-- reached the people they walk with, which for an Explorer is one Guide. A blog
-- read by one person is a letter.
--
-- WHAT THIS CHANGES.
--
--   1. Any approved member of a church may write a post in their own church.
--   2. A new audience, `church`, means everyone in that church, whoever wrote
--      it. The old `all` keeps its old meaning exactly, so no existing post
--      changes who can see it.
--   3. Leaders may delete any post in their church.
--
-- (3) IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IS THE REASON (2) IS SAFE. A church-wide audience
-- open to every member is a megaphone, and a megaphone with no off switch is a
-- safeguarding problem waiting for a Sabbath morning. Deletion by leadership is
-- the minimum that makes an open noticeboard something a church can run. It
-- does not touch the author's own right to delete, and it is scoped by
-- `leads_church`, so a Director cannot reach into another congregation.

begin;

-- Postgres will not let a value added to an enum be USED in the same
-- transaction that adds it. `can_read_post` below compares the audience as
-- text for exactly that reason, so this stays one migration rather than two
-- that have to be applied in the right order by hand.
alter type public.blog_audience_kind add value if not exists 'church';

-- Writing
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Approval is the gate, not role. Somebody waiting for a Director to let them
-- in has no business on the church noticeboard; somebody who has been let in is
-- a member of the church, and members may speak.
--
-- The two pins stay: you write as yourself, and you write into your own church.
-- Both are enforced here rather than in the app, so a hand-made request cannot
-- post as somebody else or into a congregation it does not belong to.

-- WHY AN RPC RATHER THAN A SELECT WITH A JOIN. The feed used to return
-- `author_id` and nothing else, and the screen was headed "From your Guide" —
-- correct while only a Guide could write, and a lie the moment anybody can. A
-- post on a church noticeboard has to carry who wrote it.
--
-- Reaching the name from the client means joining `profiles`, whose own
-- policies are written for a different question; a join that a policy quietly
-- empties gives a feed with every name missing and no error to explain it. This
-- is SECURITY DEFINER and returns exactly three things about the author: their
-- name, their role, and nothing else.
--
-- Access is still decided by `can_read_post`, the same function the SELECT
-- policy uses, so the RPC cannot show a post the table would have withheld.
