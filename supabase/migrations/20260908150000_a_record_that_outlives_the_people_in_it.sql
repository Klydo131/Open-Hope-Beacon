-- What happened, kept in a form that survives the people leaving.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ASKED FOR IN THESE WORDS: "before you delete, make sure to keep some records
-- of data (dont delete the data, only delete the email please and the accounts
-- of the email)" and "All the activities and important datas needs to be
-- recorded to improve the app".
--
-- WHY A SEPARATE TABLE RATHER THAN TRUSTING THE ROWS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE.
-- Thirty-seven tables cascade off `profiles`. Deleting an account does not
-- leave its history behind; it takes the pairings, the prayer requests, the
-- materials, the lessons, the meetings and the journey events with it. So any
-- record meant to outlive an account cannot hold a foreign key to one, and this
-- table deliberately holds none.
--
-- WHAT MAY GO IN IT, AND WHAT MAY NOT. Counts, dates, stages, durations, roles.
-- No name, no e-mail, no phone number, no message body, no prayer text, no note
-- anybody wrote about anybody. A person appears as a hash of their id and
-- nothing else, which keeps two rows about the same person joinable without
-- keeping the person. Once the accounts are gone the hash points at nobody --
-- that is the point of it.
--
-- The rule is not enforceable in SQL, so it is written here where whoever adds
-- the next snapshot will read it, and the insert path is leadership's alone.
