-- Feedback that goes somewhere.
--
-- THE REPORT: "Feedback is not working, I am pretty sure some feedbacks are
-- still stuck in the database since I haven't received any email feedbacks."
--
-- Nothing was stuck. There was no feedback table, and `setFeedbackSink` is
-- never called anywhere in the app, so every message went to the DEFAULT sink
-- -- which honestly saves to the sender's own browser and says so. Each message
-- is sitting in `hope-beacon.feedback.local` on the phone of whoever wrote it,
-- has never crossed the network, and cannot be recovered centrally because it
-- was never centrally anywhere.
--
-- That design is right for the open-source default: a church cloning this has
-- no server on the first run, and a demo that silently drops feedback teaches
-- everybody that feedback is pointless. What was missing is the other half --
-- a real destination for a church that HAS a database, which this one does.
--
-- SO: a table, not an email. The built-in mailer sends about two messages an
-- hour for the whole project, so routing feedback through it would lose most of
-- it on any day worth hearing about. A row is durable, arrives instantly, and
-- can be read by the people who can act on it.
