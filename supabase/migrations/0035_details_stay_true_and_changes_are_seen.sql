-- Accuracy replaces withdrawal, and a change of details is not private from
-- the people walking with you.
--
-- THE DECISION THIS ENCODES, in the owner's words: there is no self-service
-- "withdraw permission" button. A member may change their contact details
-- whenever they like, as long as what they put there is true, and when they do,
-- their Guide and their Director see that it changed. Using the app is the
-- undertaking to keep it truthful.
--
-- WHAT THAT REPLACES. The sign-up form promised "I can withdraw this at any
-- time from Settings, and my details are removed when I do", and Settings had a
-- button that cleared them. Both go. Leaving the button while removing the
-- promise, or the reverse, would be worse than either -- a promise with no
-- mechanism is a lie, and a mechanism the app never mentions is a trap.
--
-- LEAVING IS STILL POSSIBLE, just not silently. remove_member_by_leader already
-- exists and deletes the profile outright. So the route out is a conversation
-- with a Director rather than a button, which for a church is the more honest
-- shape: somebody notices that a person has gone.
--
-- WHY A LOG RATHER THAN A NOTIFICATION. A notification is read once and lost,
-- and the question a Guide actually asks is "has this changed since we last
-- spoke", weeks later. Only a record answers that.

begin;

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. The self-service withdrawal is gone.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Dropped rather than left unused. A SECURITY DEFINER function that clears
-- somebody's details is reachable over PostgREST by anything holding a session,
-- whether or not a screen still calls it, so an unused one is not a dead
-- function -- it is an undocumented one.

-- WHY on delete cascade, when 0028 went to trouble to make the discipline log
-- OUTLIVE the person it describes. A safeguarding record answers a question the
-- church still has after somebody leaves. A list of old phone numbers does not:
-- it is contact data with no remaining purpose, and keeping it past the account
-- would be hoarding. Different records, different lifetimes, on purpose.

-- 3. The trigger that writes it.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SECURITY DEFINER so the row is written even though nobody holds an INSERT
-- policy on this table. That is deliberate: the log is append-only from the
-- outside, and the only thing that may append to it is this trigger.
