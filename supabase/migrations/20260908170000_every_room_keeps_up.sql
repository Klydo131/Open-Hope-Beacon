-- REPORTED AS: "I still dont like that most users complain that they need to
-- refresh their browser to get the real time results."
--
-- WHAT WAS ALREADY RIGHT, because it is worth ruling out before adding
-- anything. Migration 20260902020000 publishes twenty-four tables and sets
-- replica identity full on them. The browser client authenticates its realtime
-- socket and re-authenticates on every heartbeat, so a token refresh an hour
-- in does not silently kill the stream. Checked in the installed library
-- rather than assumed: @supabase/supabase-js 2.112.3 wires the custom
-- accessToken callback into the realtime client, and realtime-js calls setAuth
-- again each time a heartbeat is sent.
--
-- So neither the socket nor the publication was the fault. The fault was
-- coverage, in two halves, and this migration is the half that lives in the
-- database.
--
-- EIGHTEEN TABLES WERE NEVER PUBLISHED. A screen watching any of them receives
-- nothing however correctly it subscribes, because Postgres never writes the
-- change to the replication stream in the first place. That covers the whole
-- of Cases (trials, statements, parties), safeguarding (reports and their
-- files), the guilds and their membership, the library's record and its blocks,
-- feedback, the discipline log, a Guide's private notes, profile changes, and
-- -- the one people would notice fastest -- pairing_media, which is every file
-- sent in a conversation. A photograph arrived in a chat and the other side
-- learned about it by reloading.
--
-- AND `messages` HAS THE WRONG REPLICA IDENTITY. It is the oldest published
-- table and the only one still on `default`, which was never revisited when
-- the rest were set to `full`. Inserts and updates are unaffected, so the fault
-- is narrow: a DELETE carries only the primary key, so a subscriber filtering
-- on `pairing_id` never matches the row and a deleted message stays on screen.
-- Every other published table has been `full` since 20260902020000; this brings
-- the one that carries the most traffic into line with them.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT OFF, and this is a correction rather than a
-- decision. The first version of this migration published the safeguarding
-- tables too -- reports, trials and their statements, the discipline log, the
-- security audit, a Guide's private notes -- on the reasoning that realtime
-- runs the same row level security as a SELECT, so it widens nothing.
--
-- That reasoning is true and it is not the rule this repository already had.
-- tests/the-screen-keeps-up.mjs asserts those tables are NOT published, in as
-- many words: the safeguarding record is the last place to widen a surface for
-- a convenience nobody asked for. The gate caught it. The decision stands, and
-- it costs the Cases room, the safeguarding queue and the security audit their
-- live updates -- three screens that still need a reload, which is the right
-- trade and is written down here so the next person does not re-argue it.
--
-- WHAT PUBLISHING DOES NOT DO. It does not widen who may read anything.
-- Realtime evaluates the same row level security policies as a SELECT, per
-- subscriber, so an event is delivered only to somebody who could already have
-- read that row by asking for it. Publishing a sensitive table -- the
-- discipline log, the security audit, a trial statement -- adds a delivery path
-- for people who already have one, and adds nothing for anybody else.
