-- Approvals and refusals leave a record, like every other decision about a person.
--
-- THE HOLE THIS FILLS. `discipline_log` recorded suspending, releasing and
-- removing somebody. It did not record approving or disapproving them — so
-- "how many people did we turn away this quarter?" had no answer anywhere in
-- the database. The profile carried `is_approved = false` and nothing else:
-- not when, not who by, not whether it had ever been true. A Director asking
-- that question was asking about an event the app had never written down.
--
-- WHY APPROVALS ARE RECORDED AND NOT ONLY REFUSALS. A log that keeps only the
-- punishments reads like a charge sheet. Recording both makes it what it should
-- be: the sequence of decisions a church made about a person, which is also the
-- only form in which a refusal that was later reversed makes sense.
--
-- This was applied to the live database before the file existed. The file is
-- written to match what is running, not the other way round.
