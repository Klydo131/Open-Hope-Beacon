-- The Guide chosen on the invitation is paired the moment the Explorer arrives.
--
-- REPORTED: "The pair with Guide when I invite an Explorer for the first time
-- is not working in the sub room approval. If I pair an invited Explorer to a
-- guide, they should be paired right away."
--
-- THREE SEPARATE BUGS SAT ON THIS ONE PATH. Each was found by probing the live
-- database rather than by reading, and the third is the one that was reported.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ONE: THE APPROVAL ITSELF FAILED. Probed, a Director pressing Approve on an
-- Explorer who had a Guide named on their invitation got:
--
--   there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT
--   specification
--
-- and the person stayed unapproved. Not a missing pairing -- a locked door.
--
-- SELF-INFLICTED, EARLIER THE SAME DAY. `a_pair_can_be_made_again` dropped
-- `pairings_ds_id_dm_id_key`, the unconditional UNIQUE (ds_id, dm_id), because
-- an archived pairing held that pair's slot forever and two people who had been
-- disconnected could never be paired again. That change was right. What was
-- missed is that a trigger written long before said `on conflict (ds_id, dm_id)
-- do nothing`, and an ON CONFLICT clause needs a unique index on exactly those
-- columns with NO condition -- the partial indexes that replaced it do not
-- satisfy it. Dropping a constraint silently broke a statement inside a
-- function nobody was looking at.
--
-- Worth keeping: grep for a constraint's COLUMNS before dropping it, not only
-- its name. Nothing referenced this one by name; the ON CONFLICT referenced its
-- shape.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- TWO: `DO NOTHING` WAS THE WRONG INSTRUCTION ANYWAY. Disconnecting a pairing
-- ARCHIVES it rather than deleting it, deliberately, so the history of who
-- walked with whom survives. So for anybody who had ever been paired with that
-- Guide before, the row already existed, DO NOTHING quietly skipped, and the
-- Explorer came through with no active Guide and no message -- on the exact
-- path a Director would use to re-pair somebody. Reviving the archived row is
-- the honest answer and keeps the history.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THREE, AND THIS IS THE REPORTED ONE: AN INVITED EXPLORER IS NEVER APPROVED,
-- BECAUSE THEY ARRIVE APPROVED. `handle_new_user` sets `is_approved` to true at
-- signup for anybody holding an Explorer invitation -- the invitation IS the
-- approval, which is deliberate and stays. The pairing hung off an
-- `after update of is_approved` trigger, and for those people `is_approved`
-- never transitions: the row is INSERTED with it already true.
--
-- So for a first-time invited Explorer -- the ordinary case, the one in the
-- report -- the pairing trigger has never once fired. The Guide was recorded on
-- their profile and nothing ever read it. Nothing failed, nothing was logged,
-- and the Director simply found an unpaired Explorer.
--
-- The pairing therefore happens on INSERT as well as on approval, and both go
-- through one function so the two paths cannot drift.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- AND ARRIVING NEVER FAILS BECAUSE OF PAIRING. Approving is "let this person
-- into the church"; pairing is "and walk with this one". A Guide already
-- carrying five Explorers, or an Explorer paired by hand while the invitation
-- sat unanswered, must not be able to turn Approve -- or SIGNING UP -- into an
-- error. The pairing is attempted, and if the database refuses it the person
-- still gets in and simply has no Guide yet, which is a state the Director's
-- own screen already shows and counts.
