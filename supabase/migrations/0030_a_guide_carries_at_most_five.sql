-- A Guide may walk with at most five Explorers at once.
--
-- WHY A LIMIT AT ALL. Nothing stopped a Director pairing one willing Guide with
-- everybody who arrived. That does not fail loudly -- it fails as a Guide with
-- fourteen conversations who answers four of them, and as ten Explorers who
-- each believe somebody is walking with them. The cap makes the shortage
-- visible at the moment of pairing, which is the only moment anybody can do
-- something about it.
--
-- WHY A TRIGGER AND NOT A CHECK IN THE APP. The screen will also count, so a
-- Director sees a full Guide greyed out rather than being refused after
-- pressing the button. But the screen is not the boundary: createPairing()
-- inserts straight into the table, and anything holding a session can do the
-- same. A rule that only the button obeys is a rule that only the button obeys.
--
-- WHY NOT A UNIQUE INDEX OR A CHECK CONSTRAINT. Neither can count sibling rows.
-- A CHECK sees only the row being written; a unique index cannot express "at
-- most five". Counting across rows of the same table needs a trigger.
--
-- ARCHIVED PAIRINGS DO NOT COUNT. Only 'active' ones do, so disconnecting an
-- Explorer immediately frees a place -- which is what makes the cap workable
-- rather than a wall a church hits once and never gets past.
--
-- THE UPDATE PATH IS GUARDED TOO. Un-archiving is an UPDATE, not an INSERT, so
-- a trigger on INSERT alone could be walked straight around by archiving a
-- pairing and bringing it back once five others existed.
--
-- The owner said "five for now". It is one number in one function, changed by
-- a single create-or-replace, and nothing else reads a literal 5.
