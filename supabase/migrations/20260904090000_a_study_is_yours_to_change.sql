-- Everybody may change a study, and nobody changes it for anybody else.
--
-- THE ASK, after seeing the first attempt: "All users can edit and delete
-- Lesson privately based on their own account, not universal."
--
-- The church's shared studies are a STARTING POINT, not a fixed text. A Guide
-- who wants to cut a paragraph, change an example so it lands with the person
-- they walk with, or drop a study they will never use, should be able to. What
-- they must not be able to do is change it for the other sixteen Guides, and
-- the first version of this let a Director do exactly that, church-wide, from a
-- button that looked like an ordinary edit.
--
-- So a shared study becomes a template. The first time somebody edits one they
-- quietly get their own copy, and from then on they see theirs and nobody
-- else's view moves. Deleting one hides it for them alone.
--
-- TWO COLUMNS, NOT A NEW TABLE. A copy already needs a row, and the row already
-- has an owner and policies that let its owner change it. `copied_from` says
-- which template it replaces FOR THIS PERSON; `is_hidden` marks a copy that
-- exists only to record "I do not want this one". Both are answered by the same
-- policies that already govern a series somebody wrote, so nothing new decides
-- who may do what.

-- WHO MAY WRITE ONE AT ALL.
--
-- It was a Guide or somebody who manages the church, which is right for
-- publishing a study to a congregation and wrong for keeping a private copy of
-- one. "All users" was the ask, and an unpublished series nobody else can read
-- is not a thing that needs a rank: `ls_read` already shows a series to its own
-- author and to everybody only once it is published.
