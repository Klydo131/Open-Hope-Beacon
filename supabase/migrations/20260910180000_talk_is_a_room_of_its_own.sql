-- The conversations a person has, and how many are waiting.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THIS EXISTS.
--
-- Reported: the chat should be a place you go, not a card you scroll past.
-- "Most users want always the present chat that doesn't need to scroll down for
-- other features, specially for Explorers... For guides... they want the Chat to
-- be exclusive only because it's their main connection to the Explorers."
--
-- A standalone chat surface needs two things the app could not answer:
--
--   1. WHICH CONVERSATIONS DO I HAVE. An Explorer has one; a Guide has up to
--      five, and needs them in one place with the waiting ones on top.
--   2. HOW MANY ARE WAITING. Without a count there is no badge, and without a
--      badge a chat you have to open to check is a chat you forget.
--
-- WHY A FUNCTION RATHER THAN A QUERY. The obvious client version is "select
-- every message in my pairings and count in JavaScript", which downloads every
-- word of every conversation to display a number. It works at this church's
-- size and stops working quietly. One round trip, no bodies except the one line
-- the list actually shows.
--
-- IT DISCLOSES NOTHING NEW. Every row it returns is a pairing this caller is
-- already in and messages they can already read -- `in_pairing` is the same test
-- `messages_read` applies. The preview is the last line of a conversation they
-- are a party to.
