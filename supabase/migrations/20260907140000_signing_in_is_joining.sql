-- Somebody who has signed in has joined, and their password is theirs to keep.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- REPORTED TWICE IN ONE BREATH:
--
--   "some e-mails are already in the system but still in the re-send mail
--    list, any e-mail that is already part of the Open Sentry Beacon should not
--    be in the re-send mail list."
--
--   "When the E-mail invitation is sent, access to password is randomized, but
--    once the user clicked and used the account the e-mail password that was
--    sent should remain and can't be changed because that's a resident account
--    already."
--
-- Both are the same fault, and it is one column.
--
-- WHAT "JOINED" MEANT, AND WHY IT STOPPED BEING TRUE. `signup_completed_at` is
-- stamped by the sign-up form, at the moment somebody chooses their own
-- password. That was the last step of the old one-time-link flow, so it was a
-- perfectly good test of "this person is really here".
--
-- The invitation carries a PASSWORD now. The account is created before the
-- message leaves, the person signs in at /login with the address and password
-- in the e-mail, and they never see the sign-up form at all. Nothing stamps the
-- column. So the app has been asking a question that the current design can no
-- longer answer, and taking silence for "not here yet".
--
-- Measured on the live table: 82 people have signed in, and EIGHT of them have
-- no signup_completed_at. Those eight are using the app and are still sitting
-- on the Director's re-send list.
--
-- WHY THE SECOND REPORT IS THE SERIOUS ONE. The Re-send button beside those
-- rows calls the invite function, and that function refuses an address that has
-- already joined -- by reading exactly this column. For those eight it reads
-- null, so the refusal never fires, and a re-send REPLACES THE PASSWORD on the
-- account of somebody already using it. If they had changed it to one of their
-- own, that is gone, and the first they learn of it is being locked out. A
-- Director tidying up their list by pressing Re-send would do that to eight
-- people.
--
-- The comment in the invite function says "NOBODY'S WORKING PASSWORD IS EVER
-- OVERWRITTEN. An address that has finished signing up is refused far above
-- this point". That was true when it was written. The flow moved underneath it.
--
-- THE ANSWER IS ALREADY IN THE DATABASE. `auth.users.last_sign_in_at` is the
-- thing the old column was standing in for: it is set the moment somebody
-- actually gets in, whichever door they used. Note that church_invitations was
-- ALREADY reading it -- and reporting it as `opened_at`, drawn on screen as
-- "link opened, no password set yet". The app knew these people had signed in
-- and said the opposite.
--
-- NOTHING IS REWRITTEN. Both functions coalesce rather than backfilling, so
-- signup_completed_at keeps meaning exactly what it says and no stored row is
-- given a value it did not earn.
