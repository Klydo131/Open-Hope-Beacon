-- An Explorer marks a study read, and their leaders can see how far they have got.
--
-- THE ASK, in the owner's words: "Can we add the progress bar that can be
-- recorded by the EDs and Directors if the Explorer is really Reading the
-- Lesson studies from the samples and the Guide made for the Explorer."
--
-- WHAT DID NOT EXIST. `lesson_assignments` records that a Guide handed a whole
-- SERIES to a pairing, and carries one `completed_at` for the series. Nothing
-- anywhere recorded a single lesson being read, so there was no numerator for a
-- progress bar and no way to answer "has this person actually opened anything?"
-- The demo half of the app has had a bar since the beginning; the live half,
-- the one real people use, had none.
--
-- THE HONEST NUMERATOR, AND WHY IT IS A BUTTON. The obvious implementation is
-- to mark a lesson read when it appears on screen. That would be a lie here,
-- and a particularly bad one: `SeriesBody` renders EVERY lesson of an open
-- series expanded at once, so opening a six-lesson series would instantly
-- record six lessons read. A Director looking at that bar would be reading a
-- measurement of one tap. So the Explorer says so themselves, per lesson, and
-- the bar means what it appears to mean.
--
-- WHO MAY WRITE ONE. Only the person it is about. Not the Guide, not a
-- Director, not an Executive Director -- if a leader could tick lessons off on
-- somebody else's behalf, the number stops being evidence of anything. This is
-- the whole point of the feature, so it is a policy rather than a convention.
--
-- WHO MAY READ ONE. The Explorer, the Guide walking with them, and the
-- Directors and Executive Directors of that Explorer's church. Note the church
-- is the READER'S church, not the church that wrote the lesson: the sample
-- studies are seeded material that no local church authored, and scoping by the
-- lesson's church would have hidden exactly the sample progress that was asked
-- for.
--
-- UNMARKING IS ALLOWED, for the person themselves only. Somebody who taps the
-- wrong row should be able to put it back rather than live with a number they
-- know is wrong; a progress bar nobody can correct is a progress bar people
-- learn to ignore.
