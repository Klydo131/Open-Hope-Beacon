-- Close the doors nobody uses.
--
-- Nothing here fixes a leak that is happening. The audit that produced this
-- migration probed every table in the schema as the signed-out `anon` role and
-- every one of them returned zero rows. The problem is WHY they returned zero.
--
-- THE SHAPE OF THE RISK. Supabase grants `anon` and `authenticated` every
-- privilege on every new table by default, and Row Level Security is what takes
-- it back. A policy written without a `TO` clause applies to PUBLIC — which
-- includes `anon`. Thirteen policies here were written that way. They are safe
-- today only because each one compares something against `auth.uid()`, which is
-- NULL for a signed-out caller, so the test can never be true.
--
-- That is safety by arithmetic, not by design. The anonymous key ships inside
-- the JavaScript bundle; anyone who opens the app has it. The day somebody adds
-- a reasonable-looking policy — `using (is_published)`, say, or
-- `using (church_id = ...)` — that table becomes readable by the whole internet,
-- and nothing in the review would look wrong. Four tables were additionally
-- being saved by an accident: their policy calls a helper that reads a table
-- `anon` cannot read, so the query RAISES instead of returning nothing. Remove
-- that helper's inner read some day and the accident stops saving them.
--
-- So: `anon` loses every table privilege, because the app never signs in as
-- `anon` for data. Every policy names `authenticated` explicitly. And a new
-- event trigger does for table grants what `lock_new_functions` already does
-- for function grants, so the next table created cannot reintroduce this.
--
-- TWO STORAGE POLICIES WERE GENUINELY TOO WIDE. `lesson_file_read` and
-- `avatar_read` matched on the folder name alone, so any signed-in account
-- could list and download every lesson file and every avatar in the instance,
-- regardless of church. The `lesson_files` METADATA table is correctly scoped
-- with `church_id = my_church_id()`; the bytes were not scoped at all. There is
-- one church and zero lesson files today, so nothing has been exposed — which
-- is exactly why this is the cheap moment to fix it, before there are files to
-- migrate and before the second church makes it real.
--
-- SCOPING THE AVATARS TURNED UP SOMETHING ELSE. Ten avatar images are stored;
-- only seven belong to a profile that still exists. Three were uploaded by
-- accounts that have since been deleted, and the pictures stayed behind. No
-- screen renders them, because there is no profile left to render — they were
-- simply unreachable rather than gone. A person who asks to be deleted and
-- whose photograph remains on the server has not been deleted, so the last
-- section makes the bytes follow the account out.

begin;

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. The signed-out role keeps nothing.
--
-- Checked first, and it matters: no function in either schema is executable by
-- `anon`, and no screen queries a table before sign-in. The one that looked
-- like it did — the /setup health probe — was already receiving `42501` and
-- calling the database "unreachable". That is fixed on the app side.

-- 2. Every policy says who it is for.

-- 3. What `lock_new_functions` does for functions, this does for tables.
--
-- `ensure_rls` already turns RLS on for a new table. That is half the job: RLS
-- decides which ROWS a role may see, and the grant decides whether the role may
-- ask at all. Without both, a new table arrives holding the default grant, and
-- the next policy written without a `TO` clause opens it.
--
-- It never blocks DDL. An over-granted table is a finding; a database that
-- refuses migrations is an outage. Same trade, same reason, as the sibling.
