-- The trial room: suspending a member, and removing one.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS FOR. A church running this app has no other lever. If somebody
-- sends an Explorer something they should not have, the leadership needs to be
-- able to act tonight, from a phone, without a developer. Reports (0021) gave
-- them the evidence; this gives them the response.
--
-- TWO DIFFERENT ACTS, and conflating them is the mistake to avoid:
--
--   JAIL (suspend)  They stay in the church and keep their history. They
--                   cannot sign in, message, or be paired. Reversible by the
--                   leadership that imposed it. This is for "we are looking
--                   into it" and for "you are out until you have spoken to us".
--   KICK (remove)   They are gone. Already exists as remove_member().
--
-- WHO MAY DO WHAT — enforced here, in the database, not in a screen:
--
--   Executive Director  may suspend or remove admin, dm, ds.
--   Director            may suspend or remove dm and ds ONLY. Never another
--                       Director, and never an Executive.
--   Nobody              may suspend or remove themselves. A church that
--                       accidentally locks out its own leadership has no way
--                       back in without a developer, which is exactly the
--                       dependency this app exists to remove.
