-- The example studies are Christ-centred, plainly written, and sourced.

-- WHAT WAS ASKED FOR, in two messages:
--
--   "I want the sample lesson studies to have sources with the 7th day
--   Adventist sources please, not some random published no basis points.
--   Explorers should see more on Christ than the church doctrine (but it must
--   have embed with 7th day Adventist values too)... I dont want to see lesson
--   studies that are just random automated by AI, it must have a strong
--   content with strong sources too."
--
--   "Also please remove the churchy words for Explorers since they are new in
--   faith too, let's focus more on Christ centered them for Explorers for we
--   dont know if they have sensitive to religion or not."
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG. The four example series read reasonably and cited NOTHING.
-- Every lesson was about 360 characters of pleasant prose with a Bible
-- reference and no indication of where any of it came from -- which is exactly
-- what AI-written filler looks like, and a Guide handing it to somebody had no
-- way to answer "says who?".
--
-- WHAT CHANGED, AND THE THREE RULES BEHIND IT.
--
-- ONE: EVERY LESSON NAMES ITS SOURCE. Not a vague appeal to tradition -- a book,
-- a chapter, and where to read it free. The sources are the Seventh-day
-- Adventist Church's own and nobody else's:
--
--   * Ellen G. White, `Steps to Christ` (1892) and `The Desire of Ages` (1898),
--     free from the Ellen G. White Estate at m.egwwritings.org
--   * The 28 Fundamental Beliefs, at adventist.org/beliefs
--   * The Discover Bible Guides from Voice of Prophecy, which exist for exactly
--     this reader and are free
--
-- Those addresses were checked before being written down, not recalled.
--
-- TWO: CHRIST FIRST, DOCTRINE SECOND, FOR AN EXPLORER. `Steps to Christ` is the
-- most Christ-centred thing in the Adventist library and barely doctrinal at
-- all, which is why it is the spine of the first series. An Explorer meets
-- Jesus with people -- a man nobody would touch, a woman everybody was ready to
-- stone, a tax collector up a tree -- long before they meet a teaching about
-- him. The Adventist values are there in every one of them: that God is love,
-- that the body matters, that rest is a gift, that the future is not something
-- to be frightened of. Embedded, as asked, rather than announced.
--
-- THREE: NO INSIDE WORDS FOR SOMEBODY WHO MAY BE WARY OF RELIGION. The first
-- series uses none of: salvation, sin, grace, repentance, righteousness,
-- atonement, sanctification, testimony, backsliding, saved, born again, the
-- Lord, doctrine. Not because those words are wrong, but because a person who
-- did not grow up with them hears a closed door. `tests/the-studies-are-sourced.mjs`
-- fails if one gets back in.
--
-- The rows are UPDATED IN PLACE, ids unchanged. Anybody who has already taken
-- their own copy of one keeps it exactly as it was -- copies are separate rows
-- with `copied_from` pointing here, so nothing anybody wrote is touched.

Before anything about Jesus, one idea has to be tested — that being fully known might not be a threat.

**Read:** Psalm 139, verses 1 to 12.

Notice what it does not do. It does not argue anyone into anything. It describes being known — every word before it is said, every road taken, the dark included — and treats that as comfort rather than surveillance.

**To think about:** if someone knew you completely, the parts you keep hidden included, would that frighten you or come as a relief? Answer honestly. Both answers are common, and the second one usually takes a while.

Jesus told a story to correct that picture, and he told it to people who were sure they already knew the answer.

**Read:** Luke 15, verses 11 to 24 — the son who spent everything and came home.

The son has a speech ready. He has rehearsed it the whole way. He never finishes it, because the father is already running, and in that culture a grown man did not run. The father makes himself look ridiculous to reach his son a few seconds sooner.

**To think about:** whose face do you see when you imagine God looking at you? Where did that face come from — something you were taught, or something that happened to you?

**Where this comes from:** *Steps to Christ*, chapter 1, argues that Jesus told stories like this precisely because people had inherited a picture of God that was not true and could not be argued away, only replaced. Free at m.egwwritings.org/en/book/108/toc'

Leprosy in the first century meant more than illness. It meant living outside the town, calling out a warning when anyone approached, and going untouched for years — sometimes for life.

**Read:** Mark 1, verses 40 to 42.

Jesus could have healed him with a word. He had done that before and would again. Instead he reached out and touched him first. Under the law of the time, touching made Jesus unclean rather than making the man clean. He did it anyway, and it worked the other way round.

**To think about:** is there a part of your life you assume would have to be cleaned up before you would be welcome anywhere? What if the order runs the other way?

Two things are worth slowing down for. He does not pretend she has done nothing wrong; he is the only person present who does not throw anything. And he says the thing that empties the square: whoever has never done anything wrong goes first. They leave oldest to youngest, which is its own quiet comment on how much any of us has to be proud of.

**To think about:** which is harder to accept — that he refused to condemn her, or that he refused to pretend it did not matter? Most people find one of those much harder than the other.

Read it slowly, because the middle of it is easy to skip. He does not offer an escape from work. He offers a lighter load and better company while carrying it. The word he uses is the wooden yoke two animals share — one experienced, one not — so that the stronger one carries most of the weight.

Jesus is hours from death. Beside him is a man being executed for his own crimes, who says so out loud. He has no time left to become a better person, nothing to offer, and no way to make anything right. He asks one thing: remember me.

The answer comes back without conditions and without a delay.

**To think about:** that conversation is either the most reckless thing in the book or the whole point of it. Which do you think it is, and what would it mean if it were the second?

His answer is one sentence and it settles the question of what the day is for: the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. It is a gift given to people, not a test set for them. Everything else about the day follows from which way round that is.

A king has a dream he cannot shake. What he is shown is a statue made of falling-value metals — gold at the head down to clay at the feet — and every empire in it comes and goes. The thing the passage is most interested in is the last line: a kingdom that does not get replaced by the next one.
