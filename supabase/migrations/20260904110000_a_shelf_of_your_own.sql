-- You can take a resource off YOUR shelf without taking it off everybody's.
--
-- THE ASK: "for the samples, users can add and remove it too."
--
-- Adding was already open to everybody -- migration 20260901090000 widened it
-- to Explorers. Removing was not, and could not simply be widened, because the
-- library is one shared shelf: a Guide pressing Remove on a link the church
-- added would take it off sixteen other people's shelves, and the person who
-- pressed it would have no idea they had done that.
--
-- This is the same answer the lesson studies got, for the same reason. A shared
-- resource somebody else added is hidden for you alone. One you added yourself
-- is really deleted, because it is yours.
--
-- A TABLE HERE, NOT A COLUMN, and the difference from lesson_series is worth a
-- sentence. A study is copied when you change it, so the copy already needs a
-- row and the hide could ride along on it. A link has nothing to copy -- there
-- is no private version of a URL -- so the only fact to record is "not on my
-- shelf", and a row per person per link is exactly that fact and nothing else.
