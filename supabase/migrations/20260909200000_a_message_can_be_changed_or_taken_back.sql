-- Editing and deleting a message, and the record that survives both.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT WAS ASKED FOR, AND THE HOLE IT WAS ABOUT TO BE BUILT ON TOP OF.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Asked for: "Messages in chat can be edited and be deleted (if it's deleted
-- there must be a message or note 'user X has deleted a message')."
--
-- Before any of that, a live fault, found while looking for where edit would
-- go. `messages_mark` is an UPDATE policy that exists so the RECIPIENT can
-- stamp `read_at`:
--
--     for update to authenticated
--     using (in_pairing(pairing_id)) with check (in_pairing(pairing_id))
--
-- RLS is row level. That policy says nothing about WHICH COLUMNS may change and
-- nothing about being the author, so it also permitted this, verified against
-- the live database rather than reasoned about:
--
--     UPDATE by the other person affected 1 row(s)
--
-- EITHER PERSON IN A PAIRING COULD SILENTLY REWRITE THE OTHER'S WORDS. No
-- trace, no attribution, nothing on screen to show it had happened. In an app
-- where the conversation IS the safeguarding record and some Explorers are
-- children, that is the whole record being untrustworthy. Nobody appears to
-- have used it; that is luck, not a control.
--
-- Deleting, by contrast, was simply impossible: no DELETE policy, so a delete
-- matched no rows and silently did nothing.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE SHAPE, AND WHY DELETING DOES NOT DESTROY ANYTHING.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- This app already has a rule for this, written after the Guild Room shipped
-- without it: every place one person can be hurt by another has a way to report
-- it, somebody whose job it is to look, and A RECORD THAT OUTLIVES THE PERSON
-- IT DESCRIBES. `report_guild_post` copies the post's words into the report
-- precisely because the first thing a reported person does is delete.
--
-- So a delete here is not a delete. The words are MOVED, not destroyed:
--
--   * `message_revisions` keeps what was said, with why it stopped being said.
--     RLS on, NO POLICY, no grant -- unreadable from any browser, by anybody,
--     including the two people in the conversation. Leadership reads it through
--     a definer function when a report is being looked at, and nowhere else.
--   * `messages.body` is emptied, so the row a browser can read no longer
--     carries the words. This is the Guild wall lesson applied: realtime and
--     RLS are ROW level, so hiding a column means taking it out of the row.
--   * `deleted_at` and `deleted_by` stay on the row, because the note asked for
--     -- "X deleted a message" -- is the point of the feature.
--
-- An edit keeps the previous wording the same way. Editing is not a way to
-- rewrite what you said after being challenged on it; it is a way to fix a typo
-- while the record of both versions stays.

-- THE COLUMNS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

alter table public.messages
  add column if not exists edited_at  timestamptz,
  add column if not exists deleted_at timestamptz,
  add column if not exists deleted_by uuid references public.profiles (id);

-- A live message still has to say something. A deleted one has to say nothing:
-- the check would otherwise refuse the empty body that removes the words from
-- the row, and the words would have to stay where the browser can read them.
alter table public.messages drop constraint if exists messages_body_check;
alter table public.messages add constraint messages_body_check
  check (
    (deleted_at is null     and length(body) between 1 and 4000)
    or
    (deleted_at is not null and length(body) = 0)
  );

comment on table public.message_revisions is
  'What a message said before it was edited or deleted. RLS on with no policy: '
  'unreadable from a browser by anybody, including the two people in the '
  'conversation. Read by leadership through a definer function when a report is '
  'being looked at.';

alter table public.message_revisions enable row level security;
-- NO POLICY AND NO GRANT, deliberately. See the comment above. This is the same
-- pattern as security_audit_events: a record kept about people, that the people
-- it is about cannot reach.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CLOSING THE HOLE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- RLS cannot say "only this column". Column privileges can, and they compose:
-- the policy still decides WHICH ROWS, the grant decides WHICH COLUMNS. After
-- this, the only thing a browser may change on a message is the read receipt,
-- which is the only thing the app ever changed.
--
-- Editing and deleting go through the definer functions below instead, which
-- can check that the caller is the author -- something a policy of this shape
-- was never going to do.
