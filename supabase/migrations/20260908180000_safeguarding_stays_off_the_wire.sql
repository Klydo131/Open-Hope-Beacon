-- The safeguarding record does not travel over a socket.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THIS IS A CORRECTION, and it is worth saying so plainly rather than dressing
-- it as a decision.
--
-- The first version of 20260908170000 published the safeguarding tables along
-- with everything else: reports and their files, trials and their statements
-- and parties, the discipline log, the security audit, and a Guide's private
-- notes. The reasoning was that realtime evaluates the same row level security
-- as a SELECT, so publishing a table adds a delivery path for people who
-- already have one and adds nothing for anybody else.
--
-- That reasoning is correct and it is not the rule this repository already had.
-- tests/the-screen-keeps-up.mjs has asserted since it was written that those
-- tables are NOT published, in as many words: the safeguarding record is the
-- last place to widen a surface for a convenience nobody asked for. "Allowed
-- by the policies" and "wise to stream" are different questions, and the
-- earlier decision answered the second one. The verify gate caught the
-- contradiction before it shipped; it did not catch it before it was applied to
-- the live database, which is why this migration exists at all.
--
-- WHAT IT COSTS, named so nobody has to rediscover it. The Cases room, the
-- safeguarding queue and the security audit do not update on their own. Those
-- three screens still need a reload, and are listed as deliberate exemptions in
-- tests/every-room-keeps-up.mjs rather than left looking forgotten.
--
-- On a database built from these migrations in order, 20260908170000 never adds
-- these tables and this migration finds nothing to drop. It is written to be a
-- no-op there and a repair on the one database where the first version ran.
