-- Stop profiles and pairings re-entering each other's policies.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY. It was applied to the reference database and
-- never written down. A fresh install from this repository therefore got the
-- policies from 0001 and not this correction — which means every install but
-- the first one would have hit `infinite recursion detected in policy for
-- relation "pairings"`, and every journey and pairing read would have failed
-- outright. Recovered from the applied migration history and committed here so
-- the repository can actually build the database it describes.
--
-- THE BUG. A policy on `profiles` asked "is this person paired with me?" by
-- querying `pairings`; the policy on `pairings` asked "does this person's
-- profile belong to a church I manage?" by querying `profiles`. Each read
-- re-enters the other's policy, Postgres refuses the whole query, and both
-- screens die together.
--
-- THE FIX. Two SECURITY DEFINER helpers cross that boundary once, without
-- re-entering anything. Every later migration in this repository uses the same
-- shape for the same reason.

-- Two helpers that read across the profiles<->pairings boundary WITHOUT
-- re-entering the other table's policies.
