-- A resource is yours until you hand it to somebody.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- REPORTED AS: "Why is it the resources are shared by other guides and
-- Explorers, it should be contained and personal with each other, not a group
-- study" -- and then, precisely: "not a group study by OTHER guides and
-- explorers. If the Guide has multiple explorers, it should be private for
-- those designated explorers."
--
-- HALF OF THAT WAS ALREADY TRUE, and it is worth saying which half before
-- changing anything. `shares_read` is `in_pairing(pairing_id)`, so a share into
-- one pairing is invisible to every other pairing: a Guide walking with five
-- people hands something to one of them and the other four cannot see it.
-- Explorers also never had the church-wide arm of `can_read_material`, which is
-- gated on `auth_role() in ('dm','admin','executive')`. So nothing ever leaked
-- between Explorers.
--
-- WHAT DID LEAK: every Guide and every Director could read every resource in
-- the church, including another Guide's private bookmark and an Explorer's own
-- addition. Not because anybody chose it. `materials.is_published` DEFAULTS TO
-- TRUE and no screen in this app has ever set it -- there is no publish control
-- for resources anywhere. So "published to the whole church" has meant, in
-- practice, "exists". The column was designed for a decision nobody was ever
-- asked to make.
--
-- Measured before writing this: twelve resources, all twelve published, eleven
-- of them also shared into a pairing. So the pool was almost entirely things
-- that were meant for somebody specific anyway.
--
-- THE CHANGE IS ONE DEFAULT AND ONE GUARD.
--
--   The default becomes false. A new resource is yours, plus whoever you hand
--   it to, and nobody else.
--
--   Publishing becomes leadership's act, enforced here rather than on a screen.
--   Without the guard the default is a suggestion: `materials_edit` already
--   lets the person who added a row update it, so anybody could set the flag
--   back to true on their own row and reach the whole church by another route.
--
-- NOTHING IS REWRITTEN. The twelve rows already on the church shelf stay there,
-- by the owner's decision: nothing anybody can see today disappears. This
-- migration writes no rows at all.

-- 3. THE GUARD ON THE WAY UP.
--
-- `materials_edit` lets whoever added a row update it, which is right for a
-- title and a link and wrong for this flag. A policy cannot see the OLD row, so
-- the rule that only a promotion is refused belongs in a trigger. Taking
-- something back OFF the shelf stays open to whoever may edit the row: undoing
-- exposure needs no permission.
