-- Safeguarding reports, for the live app.
--
-- The demo has had this since the day it was asked for; the live database has
-- not, which means a real church with real members had no route at all. A Guide
-- and an Explorer talk privately and nobody else can read it — right for the
-- conversation, and exactly the design that needs a way out.
--
-- THE ACCESS RULES ARE THE FEATURE. Get them wrong and this is worse than
-- having nothing, because people will trust it.
--
--   INSERT  through report_person() only, never directly. The church is
--           derived from the reporter's own profile rather than accepted from
--           the browser, and the subject must be in that same church.
--   SELECT  the church's Directors and Executive Directors. Nobody else. NOT
--           the subject, obviously, and not the reporter either — they are
--           told it went through at the time, and every extra read path is
--           another way for the wrong person to see it.
--   UPDATE  the same Directors, to record a decision.
--   DELETE  nobody. There is deliberately no delete policy. A safeguarding
--           record that can be made to disappear is not a record.
