-- Prayer requests, and a wall that cannot name anybody.
--
-- TWO AUDIENCES, GIVEN DIFFERENT THINGS ON PURPOSE.
--
-- A Guide sees their own Explorers' requests WITH the name attached, because
-- praying for someone you are walking with is the whole point and a nameless
-- request is not something you can follow up in a conversation.
--
-- The congregation sees shared requests with NO name at all. That is served by
-- a SECURITY DEFINER function rather than by a policy, and the difference
-- matters: a policy grants whole ROWS, and the row carries ds_id, so "leaders
-- see the request but not who wrote it" would be a promise the network tab
-- disproves in one click. The function returns only the columns it is willing
-- to say out loud.
--
-- WHY A DIRECTOR IS NOT GIVEN NAMES. Leaders see totals and never an identity;
-- a Director who needs to know how one person is doing asks their Guide. That
-- is a decision about what this product is, not an oversight — and it is worth
-- writing here because the sibling deployment had it reported as a bug ("the
-- admin cannot see the prayer") when it was working exactly as designed.
--
-- PROVED AGAINST THE REAL DATABASE, with positive controls:
--
--   author (Explorer)   sees their own request            1   <- control
--   their Guide         sees it, with the name            1   <- control
--   their Guide         sees an unshared one              1   <- control (paired)
--   another Guide       sees anything                     0
--   unpaired Explorer   sees anything                     0
--   anon                sees anything                     0
--   Director            reads the table directly          0
--   Director            reads prayer_wall()               1   <- control
--   prayer_wall()       returns any ds_id column         no
--   an Explorer edits somebody else's request     0 rows changed
