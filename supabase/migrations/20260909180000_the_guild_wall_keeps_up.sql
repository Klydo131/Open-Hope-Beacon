-- The Guild Room wall keeps up, WITHOUT handing over who wrote what.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE PROBLEM, AND WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX IS THE ONE THING THAT MUST NOT HAPPEN.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The Guild Room is the one screen where several people look at the same wall
-- at once, so it is the screen where a stale view is most obvious -- and it was
-- the last room in the app that still needed a manual refresh.
--
-- `guild_activity_posts` and `guild_activity_amens` are published to realtime
-- and have row level security on with NO read policy, so every event is
-- dropped. The obvious repair is a read policy on the posts. That repair would
-- be a safeguarding regression, and it is worth being exact about why.
--
-- The wall is PSEUDONYMOUS. `private.list_guild_activity` never returns
-- `author_id`; it computes a label:
--
--     'You'  ·  'A Guide'  ·  'A fellow Explorer'
--
-- and `guild_activity_amens.person_id` is exposed only as a count and a
-- "did I amen this" boolean. So a member reads the wall without learning which
-- of the people in their guild wrote which post, or who agreed with it.
--
-- Realtime delivers THE ROW, not the function's output. A read policy on either
-- table would put `author_id` and `person_id` on the wire, and any member could
-- map every post and every amen back to a person. That is a bigger change than
-- "the wall updates", and it is not the change that was asked for.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD: WATCH A SIGNAL THAT CARRIES NO IDENTITY.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- One row per guild saying only "this wall changed, and this is the nth time".
-- No author, no body, no post id, nothing about a person. The browser learns
-- that there is something new and re-asks `list_guild_activity`, which redacts
-- exactly as it always has. The raw row never leaves the database.
--
-- This is the same shape the Library record already uses -- watch the cause,
-- not the ledger -- and the reason the old headstone in lib/live/keep-up.ts
-- said there was nothing safe to watch is simply that this table did not exist
-- yet. It does now.
--
-- WHAT A MEMBER CAN LEARN FROM THE PULSE, STATED PLAINLY RATHER THAN GLOSSED.
-- That their guild's wall changed, and when. They can already read that wall,
-- and the feed already shows amen counts, so this reveals nothing the redacted
-- feed does not. It does not say who acted, and it is readable only by an
-- approved, unsuspended member of that guild -- the same test the feed itself
-- applies, reused rather than restated so the two cannot drift apart.
