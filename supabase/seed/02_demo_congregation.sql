-- A church with people in it, so a new install has something to show.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. A correctly installed Hope Beacon is indistinguishable from
-- a broken one until somebody is in it: you sign in as the Director, the app
-- works perfectly, and every screen is empty. That is not a bug and it is a
-- terrible first five minutes. This puts a small congregation in — two Guides,
-- three Explorers, conversations, a blog post, prayer, a library, meetings —
-- so the app you just deployed looks like the app in the demonstration.
--
-- SAFE TO RUN TWICE. Every insert is keyed on a fixed id or guarded by a
-- conflict clause, so re-running changes nothing rather than doubling
-- everything.
--
-- THESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE. Every address is on `example.test`, a domain
-- reserved by RFC 6761 that can never be registered, so none of it can reach an
-- inbox by accident. The password below is deliberately weak and shared.
--
-- ############ DELETE THIS DATA BEFORE REAL MEMBERS JOIN ############
-- The last section of this file is the removal script. Read it now, so you
-- know it exists before you need it.
