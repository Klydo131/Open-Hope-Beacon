// How we treat each other here.
//
// WRITTEN TO BE READ, which is the whole difficulty. Every church has a
// safeguarding policy and almost nobody has read one: they are written by
// lawyers, for lawyers, to survive a complaint rather than to prevent one. A
// policy nobody finishes protects nobody.
//
// So: short sentences, no clause numbers, no "the Organisation shall", and the
// part people actually need — how to report, and what happens next — near the
// top rather than buried at the end. The audience is a church member in their
// forties who is not technical and is possibly upset.

              A Director reads it, and can read the conversation it came from in

              quoted line.

              They decide. That may be a conversation, a pause, or removing the
              person from the church&rsquo;s Hope Beacon. It may also be that
              there was nothing to answer. That happens, and it is not held
              against you for raising it.
            </li>
            <li>
              The report is kept either way. Reports are never deleted, so the
              record stays complete whatever was decided.

            Your name is visible to the Directors. They need it so they can ask
            you what happened, support you, and tell a genuine concern from a
            grudge. The person you
            reported is the one who is never told.

              <strong>A report opens that one conversation</strong> to the

              is why reporting is a deliberate act and not a button you press by

              They can see who is paired with whom, who has joined, and how the
