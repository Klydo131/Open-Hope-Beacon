// Why this exists when there is already a service-worker update check: because
// that check can only ever work through the service worker, and a worker that is
// wedged — or one whose script the browser believes is unchanged — reports "no
// update" forever. That is exactly the failure people hit: the app kept saying it
// was current while the server had moved on several releases, and the only way
// out was to uninstall and reinstall.
//
// This route does not care about the worker at all. The page fetches it with
// cache: 'no-store' and a cache-busting query, compares the build id it gets back
// with the one baked into its own bundle at build time, and if they differ it
// KNOWS it is stale — no service-worker cooperation required. That makes the
// check honest even when everything below it has failed.
