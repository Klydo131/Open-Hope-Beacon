# Onboarding a church

How a church actually uses this app: who does what, in what order, and which
steps deliberately do **not** happen in the app at all.

Read the first section and you will know the model. The rest is detail.

> **What you are running.** As shipped there is no backend. Every account,
> message and pairing lives in your own browser, and nothing leaves your device.
> The flow below is the real one and you can click all of it — but where it says
> a rule is enforced by the database, that is a rule *your* deployment has to
> enforce once you connect one. See [BACKENDS.md](./BACKENDS.md) and
> [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

                                        recommended them, at CONNECT
                                                │
                                                ▼
                                        Missionary walks with them:
                                        CARE → CALL → CULTIVATE
                                             → COMMISSION
```

**The journey begins at Create for a Guide and at Connect for an Explorer.** An
Explorer is never at Create, because by the time they have an account a Guide
already brought them.

## Step by step

### 1. Create the church, and its Director

Whoever runs the deployment creates the church record and invites its first
**Director**. The Director is the only account that has to exist before anything else
can happen.

The Director is the church's coordinator: they approve people, invite people, pair
people, and keep the resource library. In a small church this is the pastor.

### 2. Church leadership approves Guides — off the app

The board, elders, or whoever decides in your church **has no account here and
does not need one.** They meet, they decide who is fit to serve, and they tell
the Director. None of that is recorded in the app, because none of it happens
there.

This matters for two reasons:

- Nobody waits for a "board approval" screen that does not exist.
- If a board member wants numbers, the Director shows them. There is no login to
  hand out, no password to manage, and no Explorer's identity exposed to a group
  of people who have no reason to see it.

If your church works differently, this is a decision and not a law — but think
carefully before giving a login to anybody whose job is to read totals.

### 3. The Director invites the Guides

Director → **Invite** → name, email, role **Guide**.

In a real deployment the person receives an email with a one-time link. Make it
expire, and make it work only for the address it was sent to, so forwarding it
achieves nothing.

They open the link, set a password, and they are in. **A Guide starts at
Create**: an account, and no Explorers yet.

### 4. A Guide recommends an Explorer

This is the step the whole model turns on.

A Guide knows someone — a neighbour, a colleague, a friend who asked a
question after a service. That person has **no account and has never heard of
the app**.

Guide → **Recommend someone to the Director** → their name, their email, and
optionally why.

The Guide **cannot invite them**. They recommend; the Director decides. In a
real deployment, enforce that line in the database and in whatever function
sends invitations — not only in the screens. A Guide who can invite is a
Guide who can add anybody to the church's records.

### 5. The Director invites the recommended Explorer

The recommendation reaches the Director with the Guide's name against it. The
Director has two answers:

- **Invite** — an invitation goes out, carrying the recommending Guide with
  it.
- **Not now** — the recommendation is closed and the Guide is told. Nothing
  is deleted. A Guide who hears nothing back assumes the app ate it, and
  stops recommending people.

### 6. The Explorer joins, already paired

The Explorer opens their link, sets a password, and completes a short profile.

At that moment — in the same transaction that creates their account — **the
pairing is created**: with the Guide who recommended them, at stage
**Connect**. Nobody has to remember to do it, and there is no window in which a
new Explorer exists with nobody attached.

### 7. The journey

The Guide walks with them: **Care → Call → Cultivate → Commission**. Only
the Guide and the Director ever see which stage someone is on.

## Who sees what

| | Sees |
|---|---|
| **Director** | Everything in their own church. Approves, invites, pairs, monitors. |
| **Executive Director** | The same, across every church they oversee. |
| **Guide** | **Only the Explorers paired with them.** Their conversations, their journeys, their own private notes. Nothing about another Guide's Explorers. |
| **Explorer** | Their own page, their own Guide, and what has been shared with them. |
| **Church leadership** | No account. Aggregate numbers from the Director, when they ask. |

Two rules are worth stating plainly, because churches ask about both.

**An Explorer never sees a journey stage — including their own.** A stage is a note
the church keeps about a person's progress. Shown to that person it reads as a
grade. It appears on the Guide's and the Director's screens, and nowhere an
Explorer can reach. `tests/e2e/seeker-no-stage.js` enforces this; keep it passing.

**A Guide's private notes about an Explorer are private from everyone**,
including the Director and including the Explorer. They exist so a Guide can
remember what was actually said without it becoming a church record.

**As shipped, both rules are enforced by the screens alone**, which is fine for
evaluating the flow and wrong to rely on for anything real — everything here is
sample data about invented people. When you connect a backend, enforce them in
your data rules, where a request that never touches your screens still meets
them.

## Before the session: the demo teaches each person their own job

The people deciding whether a church adopts this are often in their forties,
capable, and not especially interested in software. They can learn it. What they
cannot learn from is a tutorial about somebody else's job.

So there is **one guided walk per role**. The app opens by asking *"Who are you
in your church?"* and each answer leads somewhere different.

| Who | Tasks | What it teaches |
|---|---|---|
| **Executive Director** | 3 | The church at a glance, the journey chart, and the gate everyone passes through to join. Counts, never conversations. |
| **Director** | 5 | Who is waiting, letting someone in with a role, acting on a Guide's recommendation, pairing a Guide with an Explorer, and stocking the library. |
| **Guide** | 5 | Open an Explorer, message them, advance their journey, share a resource, make your profile yours. |
| **Explorer** | 3 | Say hello, open a lesson, ask for prayer. No stage name appears anywhere. |

Each step names the screen it happens on, so that when the arrow is gone the
person still knows where the thing lives. That is the difference between being
led through a demo and being able to use the app.

**Run the walks before onboarding day.** Ten minutes each, on sample data, on a
phone. Nothing anyone presses reaches a real person. Whoever is facilitating
should have done all four, so they can answer the question that always comes:
*"can they see my messages?"*

The walks are in the app under **Settings › Tutorial**, so somebody who wants to
run theirs again a week later needs nobody's help.

The walks live in `lib/quest.ts`. If you change a screen, change the walk that
points at it — `tests/e2e/quest-roles.js` completes every walk in a real browser
and fails if an arrow points at something that is not there.

---

## What to prepare before onboarding day

A church needs surprisingly little:

1. **One Director**, with an email address they actually read.
2. **The leadership's decision** about who will serve as Guides — made
   before the session, since it happens off the app anyway.
3. **An email address for each Guide.** This is the only thing that
   commonly holds a session up. Shared family addresses and addresses nobody
   checks both cause trouble later, when an invitation goes unread.

Explorers need nothing in advance. They arrive later, through a Guide.

**Nothing is emailed in this build.** Every message the app would have sent is
captured in the Mail screen instead, worded exactly as it would arrive, so you
can read it and follow the links with no mail server anywhere.

## A realistic first session

| | |
|---|---|
| Create the church, invite the Director | 5 min |
| Director signs in, sets the church name, looks around | 10 min |
| Invite the Guides (2 min each) | 20 min for 10 |
| Walk one Guide through recommending someone | 10 min |
| Questions | 15 min |

The Guides do not all need to be in the room. Their invitations wait.

## The direction this is heading

**An Explorer becoming a Guide** is the point of the whole six-stage shape:
Commission is where somebody being walked with starts walking with somebody
else.

The promotion itself is **not built**, and it is worth saying why rather than
implying it arrives next week. It needs decisions nobody has made:

- What happens to the pairing they were in? Does it close, or stay as a
  relationship with a different shape?
- Who approves the promotion — the Director alone, or the church leadership off the
  app, like every other Guide?
- What carries over? Their journey history is a record of them as an Explorer, and
  their new Explorers should not be able to read it.

Until those are answered, promotion is done the honest way: leadership approves
them like anyone else, and the Director changes their role.

If your church has answered those questions, this is a good thing to contribute.

## Troubleshooting

**"I never got the invitation."** Check spam first. If your deployment expires
invitations, an old one needs replacing — the Director sends a new one. A link that
only works for the address it was sent to will fail if it was forwarded.

**"I signed up but I have no Explorers."** That is correct for a new Guide.
Recommend someone, or wait for the Director to pair you.

**"An Explorer joined but is not paired with me."** This happens when the Director
invited them directly rather than from your recommendation. Ask the Director to
pair you; it takes ten seconds.

**"Can the board have a login?"** They can, if you build it — but the design
says no. Ask the Director for the numbers. A login exists to *do* something, and
reading a total is not that.
