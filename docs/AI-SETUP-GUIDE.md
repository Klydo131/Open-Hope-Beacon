# Setting up Hope Beacon with an AI assistant

**For IT people who would rather describe the job than type it.**

Everything in [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) can be handed to an AI assistant.
This document is about doing that *well*, because the ways it goes wrong are
specific and predictable.

Read [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) first — this assumes you know what is being
set up and why.

You can hand most of this document to an AI assistant and have it do the typing.
This section is about doing that *well*, because the failure modes are specific.

### What to use

Any of Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor. The free tiers are
enough for setup. There is a longer list in [AI-TOOLKIT.md](AI-TOOLKIT.md).

### The one thing that matters most

**Give it the repository, not a description of the repository.**

An AI that has read `supabase/migrations/0001_core_schema.sql` knows your exact
security rules. One that has only been told "it's a church app with Supabase"
will invent a plausible schema that does not match yours, and everything it
writes afterwards will be subtly wrong in a way that is hard to see.

Tools like Claude Code, Cursor and Copilot Workspace read the actual files. Use
one of those if you can. If you are using a chat window, paste the real file.

### Prompts that work

**Setting up:**

> I am setting up Open Hope Beacon from `github.com/klydo131/open-hope-beacon`.
> Read `docs/START-HERE.md` and `docs/SETUP.md`. I am on Part 3 Step 3 and the
> SQL editor returned this error: `<paste the exact error>`. What went wrong and
> what do I run instead?

**Making a change:**

> In this repository, I want Explorers to be able to mark a lesson as finished.
> Before writing anything: read `supabase/migrations/0012_lessons_and_notifications.sql`
> and `lib/live/data.ts`, and tell me which files you would change and why.
> Do not write code yet.

That last sentence is the important one. Ask for the plan first. It takes ten
seconds to read a plan and a long time to unpick a confident wrong change.

**Understanding something:**

> Explain what `supabase/migrations/0003_invite_approval_gate.sql` does, in
> plain English, as if I do not know SQL. What could go wrong if I removed it?

### The rules, and they are not optional

**Never paste a key into a chat window.** Not the service_role key, not the
Brevo key, not your database password. Say `<my API key>` instead. If you have
already pasted one, go and rotate it now — it is a button in the same place you
created it.

**Make it show you, not tell you.** "Did that work?" gets you a cheerful yes.
"Run the query that proves it and show me the output" gets you the truth. This
document exists partly because an AI reported a fixed invitation system twice
before anyone clicked a link.

**Ask for the negative test.** If it says a security rule works, ask it to prove
the rule *blocks* what it should block. A test where nothing fails has proved
nothing. Every security fix in this project is checked that way, and the reason
is that a test suite once passed while refusing four things for a completely
unrelated reason.

**It will be confidently wrong sometimes.** Not occasionally — regularly, and
most convincingly on the things it half-knows. Check anything that touches money,
security, or somebody's private conversation.

## A working session, start to finish

Copy this into an assistant that can read files (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot
Workspace), one message at a time. Wait for each answer.

**1. Orient it**

> Clone `https://github.com/klydo131/open-hope-beacon` and read
> `docs/START-HERE.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`, and every file in
> `supabase/migrations/`. Then tell me, in your own words, what this app does,
> what the four services are for, and what order I have to do things in. Do not
> change anything yet.

If the summary is wrong, stop. Everything after this depends on it.

**2. Get it running locally**

> Get the app running on my machine with no database, the way the README
> describes. Tell me the exact commands and what I should see.

**3. The database**

> I have created a Supabase project. Walk me through applying every migration
> in `supabase/migrations/` in order. For each file, tell me in one line what it
> adds, so I know what I am running. Warn me about anything irreversible.

**4. Prove the security rules — do not skip this**

> Write me SQL that proves a Guide cannot read another Guide's Explorer.
> Include a positive control: a query that SHOULD succeed, so that if the
> permission check is broken in the other direction I will see it. Show me the
> output of both.

A test where nothing fails has proved nothing. This is the single most valuable
thing an assistant can do for you here.

**5. Email**

> Read `docs/EMAIL.md`. Supabase's built-in mailer sends two messages an hour
> for the whole project and that cannot be raised. Tell me whether my church
> needs an SMTP provider, and if so give me the exact dashboard steps for
> Brevo — including the IP-blocking setting, which applies to SMTP as well as
> to API keys. I will paste every credential myself. Do not ask me for a key
> and do not put one in a file.

**6. Deploy**

> Walk me through deploying to Vercel and tell me exactly which environment
> variables to set. Then tell me how to verify the deployment actually works,
> as a test I run rather than a thing you assert.

**7. Make it prove the deployment, not describe it**

> Give me a numbered list of things I click, on my phone, on mobile data with
> wifi off, that would show this deployment is genuinely working — including at
> least one that should FAIL, so I know the checks mean something. Do not tell
> me it works; tell me how I would find out that it does not.

## Prompts worth keeping

Not a session — individual jobs, for when something is already running. Each one
is written the way that actually gets a useful answer: it names the files, says
what "done" looks like, and asks for evidence rather than assurance.

### Diagnosing a failure

> Invitations stopped arriving. Do not guess. Query the Supabase auth logs,
> group the last 24 hours by hour and by status, and tell me the actual reason
> with the log lines that show it. If the answer is a rate limit, tell me the
> measured number rather than the documented one.

> This error appeared: `<paste the exact text>`. Before proposing a fix, tell me
> what state the system must be in for that message to be produced. Then tell me
> how to check whether it is in that state.

### Changing the app safely

> I want `<change>`. Before writing any code, tell me which files it touches,
> what could break that I would not notice, and which existing test would catch
> a mistake. Then wait for me.

> Read `tests/` and tell me which of my behaviours are actually covered and
> which only look covered. I want the list of things that would pass while
> broken.

### Making it your church's own

> Change every place the app says "Guide" and "Explorer" to `<our words>`.
> Find them all — including the tutorial, the emails and the policy page — and
> show me the list before you change anything.

> Rewrite `app/policy/page.tsx` to match our church's safeguarding policy,
> which is: `<paste yours>`. Keep the reading level and the structure. Do not
> add clause numbers or legal phrasing. Keep the emergency-services line first.

### Reviewing what the assistant just did

> Read back the diff you just made and argue against it. What did you assume
> that I did not tell you? What would a reviewer object to? What did you not
> test?

> You said this is fixed. Show me the command I run and the output I should
> see. If you have not run it, say so plainly instead of describing what would
> happen.

### The prompt to use when you are stuck and frustrated

> Stop proposing fixes. Write down, in order, what you actually know to be
> true from evidence you have seen this session, and separately what you are
> assuming. Then tell me which single assumption, if wrong, would explain
> everything.

## Things to watch for

**"It's working now."** Ask how it knows. This project's own history has a fixed
invitation system reported as fixed twice, while every link it produced still
failed on arrival, because nobody clicked one.

**Confident SQL against a schema it has not read.** If it did not open
`0001_core_schema.sql`, its column names are guesses that will look right.

**Security rules edited to make an error go away.** "Permission denied" usually
means the rules work. Weakening them to clear the error is how a church's
private conversations end up readable by anyone holding a key that ships in
every visitor's browser.

**Any request for a secret.** No assistant needs your `service_role` key, your
Brevo key, or your database password. If one asks, say no and paste
`<my key>` instead.

## If you do not have an AI assistant

Everything here can be done by hand. Part 7 of
[START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) is the manual path with every command, and Part 8
is the same journey for someone who has never opened a terminal.
