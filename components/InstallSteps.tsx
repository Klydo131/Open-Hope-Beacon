// How to install Hope Beacon, in whichever browser is actually in your hand.
//
// THE ASK: "I need all the installer in all browser please." The card had steps
// for four situations: Safari on iPhone, Safari on a Mac, Chrome on Android,
// and Chrome or Edge on a computer. Anybody in Samsung Internet, Opera, Brave,
// Firefox, Vivaldi or one of the smaller Chromium browsers was shown Chrome's
// menu, could not find it, and stopped. Samsung Internet alone is a large share
// of Android phones.
//
// WHY THIS IS A LIST YOU PICK FROM RATHER THAN A DETECTION.
//
// Sniffing the user agent gets the common browsers right and everything else
// wrong, silently. Two specific traps decided it:
//
//   * Brave does not put "Brave" in its user agent at all. It is detected, if
//     at all, by a `navigator.brave` object.
//   * Searching for "Hola" in a user agent matches `Le Hola`, which is a LeEco
//     PHONE MODEL and not a browser. A church member on that handset would have
//     been told they were in a browser they have never installed.
//
// So the browser in hand is a GUESS that opens the list at a sensible place,
// and the list is the feature. A person who knows what they are using can
// always pick it, including browsers nobody here has heard of.
