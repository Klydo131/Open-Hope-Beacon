// The permanent "you are in the tutorial" bar, and the way out of it.
//
// TWO SEPARATE FAILURES MADE THIS NECESSARY, both found by the owner opening
// the app rather than by any check:
//
//   1. THERE WAS NO WAY BACK. Pressing "Open the tutorial" took you to the
//      tutorial's front door, which has no app shell around it — the mode
//      switch lives in the header you only get AFTER choosing somebody to be.
//      So the front door of the tutorial was a room with no exit, and the only
//      way back to the real sign-up was editing the address bar.
//
//   2. IT LOOKED IDENTICAL TO THE LIVE APP. Same navy, same mark, same title,
//      same gold button. Somebody who pressed the button and landed here
//      concluded nothing had happened.
//
// A timed notice was already in the layout (DemoRibbon) and could not fix
// either: it appears on a schedule, it can be missed, and it deliberately hides
// while the guided walk is running — which is exactly when somebody is most
// deeply inside sample data. What was missing is something that is simply
// always there.
//
// Fixed rather than sticky, with matching body padding injected alongside it,
// because the screens underneath build their own layouts and several of them
// start with a full-height hero. A sticky element inside that flow scrolls
// away; a fixed one does not.
