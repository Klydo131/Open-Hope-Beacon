// "New", for seven days.
//
// WHY IT EXPIRES. A badge that never comes off stops being information and
// becomes decoration: after a month every second person is "new" and nobody
// reads it. Seven days is roughly a week of church life, which is the window
// where somebody actually is new to the people around them.
//
// IT IS COMPUTED, NEVER STORED. A stored boolean is correct on the day it is
// written and silently wrong a week later, with nothing to tell anybody it has
// gone stale. This reads the date it already has, every time it draws, so it
// cannot drift.
//
// WHICH DATE. signup_completed_at is when they chose a password and actually
// arrived, which is what "new" means to the people meeting them. created_at is
// when a Director typed their address, which can be weeks earlier and would
// make somebody who joined this morning look like an old hand. It falls back to
// created_at only when the first is missing.
