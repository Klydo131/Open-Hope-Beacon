// "One person is stuck on an old version and nobody can work out why."
//
// THE CAUSE, and it is not the update system. Hosts give every preview — and
// often every individual deployment — its own hostname, and to a browser a
// different hostname is a different application: its own icon, its own service
// worker, its own storage. A copy installed from one of those addresses can
// NEVER receive a production update. No amount of checking helps: the origin it
// was installed from is frozen at the build that was there that day, and the
// app is dutifully staying up to date with a version of itself that will never
// move again.
//
// lib/canonical.ts already knows this. Until now it was used for exactly one
// thing — deciding whether to OFFER an install — and was deliberately silent
// otherwise, because a banner across the front door of a preview reads to a
// casual visitor like a security warning about the site itself.
//
// THAT REASONING DOES NOT SURVIVE INSTALLATION. A visitor on a preview link
// closes the tab and the problem is over. Somebody who has INSTALLED from one
// has a permanently broken icon on their home screen, is being told by everyone
// else that the app has changed, and has no way to discover why theirs has not.
// Silence protects nobody there. So this speaks only to an installed copy, and
// it says the one thing that actually fixes it.
