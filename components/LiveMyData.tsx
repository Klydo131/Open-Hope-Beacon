// "Send me everything you have about me."
//
// Both the Philippine Data Privacy Act and the GDPR give a person the right to
// ask, and until today this app had no answer at all. docs/DATA-PROTECTION.md
// listed it as the largest gap that was engineering's to close.
//
// ON THE SCREEN RATHER THAN THROUGH AN EMAIL, because a right that needs
// somebody to answer an email is a right that waits on whoever is busy. The
// file is assembled in the browser from queries this person could already run,
// so nothing new is exposed by it existing.
//
// WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT WHAT IT LEAVES OUT is the part worth reading. A
// safeguarding report about somebody names whoever raised it, and this app
// promises that person the one they reported is never told. So reports are not
// in the file — and the file says so, says why, and says who to ask. An
// omission somebody is told about is a disclosure; the same omission in silence
// is the app deciding on their behalf that they did not need to know.

          The file itself explains each one and says who to write to if you want them
          considered: your church&rsquo;s Data Protection Officer, who can weigh it case by
          case.
