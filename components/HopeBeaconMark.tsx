// The app's mark.
//
// An open ring that flicks inward into a speech tail: a conversation someone
// left open. That is the product in one shape — one person staying with another
// — and the circle deliberately does not close.
//
// TO USE YOUR OWN LOGO: replace RING and TAIL below with your own SVG path data,
// or replace the whole <svg> with an <img>. Then run `node scripts/gen-icons.mjs`
// so the favicon and the home-screen icons are regenerated from the same
// drawing. Colours come from lib/brand.ts.
//
// Drawn as geometry rather than shipped as an image, on purpose. A pasted PNG is
// the thing people notice: it brings its own background, its own idea of white,
// its own soft edges, and it blurs on a high-density screen. This is vector at
// every size and sits on navy or on white with no halo.
//
// The geometry was matched against the supplied artwork by rendering both side
// by side and correcting three times: the ring was too thick, the tail too
// heavy, and a round cap on the arc left a notch where the tail met it. The arc
// now ends butt-capped so the tail joins it flush, and the rounded terminus at
// the bottom right is drawn explicitly.
