'use client';

// Reporting somebody, in the moment you decide to.
//
// The hard part of this is not the form. It is that a person about to use it is
// upset, unsure whether it "counts", and afraid of what happens next. Every
// choice here is aimed at that:
//
//   * WHAT HAPPENS IS STATED BEFORE THEY TYPE, not after they submit. The one
//     fact that decides whether somebody reports at all is that the other
//     person is never told, so it is the first thing on screen.
//   * THE DETAIL BOX IS OPTIONAL. Requiring an explanation asks the person to
//     write down the thing they are upset about before they are ready, and
//     some will close the dialog instead.
//   * NO "ARE YOU SURE?". A confirmation step reads as the app doubting them.
//     Reporting is reversible in the sense that matters — a Director can close
//     it as nothing to answer — so there is nothing to guard against.
//   * IT CANNOT BE FIRED BY A MIS-TAP. The control that opens it is a plain
//     text link, not a button sitting next to Send.
